  "description": "Adding a slider to this choropleth map was the bane of my existence in this project. I was able to get a map showing data from a single year, but I struggled filtering this by year. Credit to 'wahab memon' on Stack Overflow who managed to point me in the right direction. The issue was that I had not provided the necessary fields in my lookup transform, and inverting my main and lookup data helped me bring all the years for my countries. I used the help I got on a European countries topojson to make a world map topojson, which had different keys and a different json structure. The underlying data is from ourworldindata.org - https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy, and the topojson is from deldersveld.",
