- Data: The data is sourced from a URL: 'https://www.trafforddatalab.io/interactive_graphics_companion/data/gapminder.csv'.
- Field (Value): The fields used in the visualization are 'year', 'region', 'gdpPercap' (GDP per capita), and 'country'. The 'year' and 'region' fields are used to filter the data to only include records from the year 2017 and the region Europe. The 'gdpPercap' field is used to calculate the median income per person and the difference from the median for each country. The 'country' field is used as the nominal variable in the y-axis encoding.
- Transform: The data is transformed by filtering for the year 2017 and the region Europe, calculating the median income per person and the difference from the median for each country, and categorizing each country as 'Below median' or 'Above median' based on their GDP per capita.
- Mark: The mark type used in the visualization is 'bar'.
- Chart-Type: This is a bar chart.
- Encoding: The y-axis encodes the 'country' field, sorted by the mean difference from the median income per person. The x-axis encodes the 'diff' field, representing the difference from the median income per person. The color encodes the 'type' field, categorizing each country as 'Below median' or 'Above median'. The opacity is set to 0.7. The tooltip displays the 'country', 'gdpPercap', and 'diff' fields.

Features: The chart shows the income per person for different countries in Europe in 2017, with a distinction between countries that are above and below the median income.
Step 2. Operations: Median, Difference
Step 3. Questions: What is the median income per person in Europe in 2017?; Which country has the highest income per person above the median in Europe in 2017?; Which country has the lowest income per person below the median in Europe in 2017?; How much is the difference in income per person from the median for a specific country in Europe in 2017?","Level 2 NL Description:
The visualization shows the income per person for different countries in Europe in 2017. Luxembourg had the highest income per person, significantly above the median income of 29100, while Moldova had the lowest income per person, falling below the median. Albania's income per person was notably lower than the median, with a difference of -17200.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization provides a clear comparison of the economic disparities within Europe in 2017. The stark contrast between Luxembourg's high income per person and Moldova's low income per person highlights the economic inequality in the region. The case of Albania, with its income per person significantly below the median, further emphasizes this point. The visualization prompts a deeper consideration of the socio-economic factors contributing to these disparities."

However, the gross profit ratio was at its lowest in 2013, indicating a decrease in profitability despite the sales. The operating profit ratio, on the other hand, has been fluctuating over the years, but a general upward trend can be observed in recent years.","The visualization reveals an interesting trend where the highest net sales do not necessarily translate to the highest gross profit ratio, as seen in the case of 2009 and 2013. This could be due to various factors such as increased costs or decreased pricing.

Step 2. Operations: Max, Min, Trend
Step 3. Questions: What year did Nintendo have the highest net sales?; What year did Nintendo have the lowest gross profit ratio?; What is the trend of the operating profit ratio over the years?","Level 2 NL Description:
The visualization shows that Nintendo's net sales peaked in 2009, reaching its highest point. However, the gross profit ratio was at its lowest in 2013, indicating a decrease in profitability despite the sales. The operating profit ratio, on the other hand, has been fluctuating over the years, but a general upward trend can be observed in recent years.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals an interesting trend where the highest net sales do not necessarily translate to the highest gross profit ratio, as seen in the case of 2009 and 2013. This could be due to various factors such as increased costs or decreased pricing. The inconsistent trend of the operating profit ratio suggests that Nintendo's operational efficiency varies from year to year. However, the recent upward trend indicates an improvement in the company's ability to generate profit from its operations."

The color of the points represents the percentiles of the productivity distribution.

The visualization shows an upward trend in productivity distribution for firms with 1-25 employees from 2000 to 2020. The 10th and 25th percentiles show an increase from 2000 to 2010, followed by a slight decrease in 2020. The median, 75th, and 90th percentiles, however, show a consistent increase over the years. The visualization also suggests a correlation between the number of employees and productivity distribution, with higher productivity associated with a larger number of employees, albeit with some fluctuations.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a complex trend in productivity distribution over time, with different percentiles showing different patterns. While the median, 75th, and 90th percentiles show a steady increase, indicating a general improvement in productivity, the 10th and 25th percentiles show a slight dip in 2020 after an initial increase. This suggests that while the overall productivity has increased, the lower percentiles have not benefited as much in recent years. The relationship between the number of employees and productivity is also not straightforward, suggesting that other factors may be influencing productivity."

While some items like 'COMPUTER GAME 3' are experiencing a rise in prices, others like 'SWIMMING POOL ADM STND ADULT' and 'SOFT PLAY SESSION TIME PERIOD' are seeing a decrease. This suggests a diverse market with varying demand and supply dynamics. Interestingly, some items like 'ELECTRICIAN-DAYTIME RATE/HOUR' have both the lowest share of price rises and price cuts, indicating a stable price over time. The wide range in the number of unique items across different types suggests that some categories like 'Food and drink' offer more variety to consumers than others like 'Telphones and post'."

The visualization shows the average GDP per capita for various countries over a given time period. China has the highest GDP per capita at 10.870609, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo has the lowest at 0.626885. The world average GDP per capita is 1.956212. Countries like Botswana and South Korea also have notably high GDP per capita, while countries like Madagascar and Niger have some of the lowest.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a significant disparity in the economic performance of countries worldwide. Developed countries like China, South Korea, and Botswana have a much higher GDP per capita compared to developing or underdeveloped countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Niger. This pattern suggests a correlation between a country's level of development and its GDP per capita. However, there are exceptions to this trend, such as Botswana, which despite being a developing country, has a high GDP per capita."

The 'Indian' group has a higher value in the 'Controlled' model than in the 'Uncontrolled', while the 'Pakistani & Bangladeshi' group has a higher value in the 'Uncontrolled' model.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a trend where the 'South East Asian' group consistently has the highest values across both models, indicating a significant difference from other ethnic groups. Conversely, the 'White majority' group consistently has the lowest values, suggesting a distinct pattern. Interestingly, the 'Indian' group shows an exception to the general trend observed in other groups, with a higher value in the 'Controlled' model than the 'Uncontrolled'. This could imply unique factors at play within this group."

The visualization shows the error values for the Experimental Index of Private Housing Rental Prices across five areas: Northwest, Westmidlands, London, Southwest, and England. The error values range from a minimum of -4.432663 to a maximum of 5.5212402. The data points are scattered, indicating inconsistency in the error values over time. Each area has periods of both overestimation (positive error) and underestimation (negative error).

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a complex trend in the error values for the Experimental Index of Private Housing Rental Prices. There is no clear pattern of consistent overestimation or underestimation across all areas. Instead, the error fluctuates, suggesting that the index's accuracy varies over time. This inconsistency might be due to various factors affecting rental prices in different regions, such as economic conditions, housing demand and supply, and policy changes. The visualization prompts a deeper investigation into these potential influences to better understand and improve the index's accuracy."

The visualization shows the total number of voters in each department of Colombia, with Bogotá D.C. having the highest number of voters at 5,702,805 and Vaupes having the least at 21,537. The average abstention percentage across all departments is approximately 50.21%, indicating that about half of the total voters did not vote. The difference between the total number of voters and the actual voters varies significantly across departments, with Bogotá D.C. having the highest difference of 2,130,107 and Vaupes having the least difference of 13,482.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a trend of high voter abstention across all departments, with an average of 50.21%. This suggests a widespread lack of voter participation in the electoral process. The departments with the highest number of total voters, such as Bogotá D.C. and Antioquia, also have the highest number of abstentions, indicating that the issue of voter abstention is not confined to departments with smaller populations. The visualization also shows that the number of departments decreases as the total number of voters increases, suggesting that there are fewer departments with a large number of voters."

Step 2. Operations: Sum, Max, Min
Step 3. Questions: What is the total quantity of onions produced in each state over the given time period?; Which state has the maximum total quantity of onions produced?; Which state has the minimum total quantity of onions produced?; How does the quantity of onions produced change over time for a particular state?","Level 2 NL Description:
The visualization shows the total quantity of onions produced in different states over a given time period. The state of MS has the highest production with a total of 376,223,362.5, while the state of HP has the lowest production with a total of 49,983. Other states like GUJ, KNT, MP, and TN also have significant production levels. The production in the state of MS fluctuates over time, with some months having higher production than others.

Level 3 NL Description:
The visualization reveals a clear disparity in onion production across different states, with MS standing out as the top producer. This could be due to favorable agricultural conditions or policies in MS. The fluctuation in production over time in MS suggests a seasonal pattern, possibly linked to the crop's growing cycle or market demand. The low production in HP might indicate less favorable conditions for onion farming or a focus on other crops. This visualization prompts further investigation into the factors influencing these production levels and their implications for the onion supply chain."
