A bar chart entitled “Mean of Temperature Maximum by Weather Type in Seattle” that shows the Mean of temp_max by weather type.
The Mean of temp_max is plotted on the vertical x-axis from 0 to 20 with an increment of 5.
The weather type is plotted on the horizontal y-axis.
"There are 5 bars corresponding to 5 precipitation types (drizzle, fog, rain, snow, sun)."
The bars are solid blue.
"Each year, the Maximum Temperature appears to be highest when it drizzle and lowest when it snows."
"From this we can conclude that Seattle has a temperate and seasonal climate, unlike some tropical climates that do not change much throughout the year."
Seattle likely has a wide range in temperature difference.
Seattle presents mostly a sunny weather with drizzle and fog occurring frequently.
Snow is less present than rain with 12.58 occupies an average position.
The mean temperature maximum of the sun is 3x that of snow.
The difference between the max temperature of drizzle and rain is around 3 degrees.
Mean is 0 to 20.
The order from drizzle to sun is an ideal weather process .
Drizzle is the only weather with an accurate mean temperature.
It's hotter when its sunny and cooler when it snows.
It's warm during a drizzle as opposed to a rain.
It's cooler when it rains than when it's foggy.
"As expected sunny weather is the hottest and snowy is the coldest, while drizzle foggy and rainy are milder"
"The maximum temperature is usually lowest during snowy season, and highest during sunny time."
"The maximum temperature is lower during rainy weather - the more rain, the lower it gets."
"From the mean maximum temperature, one might conclude that Seattle has a temperate climate."
The average maximum temperature is highest in sunny weather (which is logical).
It is also interesting that the average maximum temperature in snow weather is almost 6 degrees.
"Fog has always reminded me of cool mornings, so I am surprised that the average maximum temperature here is higher than in the case of rain."
The snowy weather has the lowest temperatures.
The rainy weather has the second lowest temperatures.
The foggy weather has the medium maximum temperatures.
The drizzle weather has the second highest maximum temperatures.
The sunny weather has the highest maximum temperatures possible.
"The order that the maximum temperatures follow is snow, rain, fog, drizzle, sun."
"The colder and humid the weather is, the lower the temperatures are in turn."
The temperature is highest when it is sunny.
The temperature is lowest when there is snow.
"The temperature does not drop much when there is drizzle, rain and fog."
The highest temperature is just under 20.
"A horizontal bar chart entitled “Adolescent pregnancy by geographic location, in percent, 2006/2007”."
"Geographic location is plotted on the vertical y-axis for the locations Rural, Urban, and Total."
"The % of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing is plotted on the horizontal x-axis for Rural (17.9%), Urban (11.8%), and Total (15.4%)."
"In rural areas, a higher percentage of roughly 6% more women aged 15-19 have had children, while urban areas have less."
The percentage of pregnant adolescents is higher in rural locations than in urban ones.
The percentage of adolescents who began a pregnancy in rural locations corresponds to almost one fifth.
The percentage of adolescents who begun a pregnancy in urban locations corresponds to almost one eighth.
Rural cases are higher probably because there is less attention to unwanted pregnancy and because people might be less informed about how to avoid them.
The rate of adolescent pregnancy is greater in rural than urban areas.
"Rural teenagers may not have alternative entertainment versus the urban teenager, as well as better education and medical access."
Also this data is pre-social media and so teens had to actually hangout with each other back then to socialize.
Rural women typically begin childbearing between the ages of 15 and 19 at a higher rate than urban women.
The rate of rural women who begin childbearing at ages 15-19 is about 50% higher than the rate of urban women.
The majority of women in both rural and urban women will not begin childbearing between the ages of 15 and 19.
Rural women have the highest rate of pregnancy at 17.9%.
Urban women have the lowest rate of pregnancy at 11.8%.
There are other populations not being accounted for in this charter.
Women tend to have more children in rural areas than in urban.
The percentage of women having children in rural areas is higher than average.
The percentage of women having children in urban areas is lower than average.
"On average, the adolescent pregnancy rates in 2006/2007 appeared to be higher in Rural areas than in Urban areas."
The teen pregnancy rates in rural areas tends to be higher than average.
The adolescent pregnancy rates in urban areas tend to be lower than average.
Rural areas had the highest percentage of adolescent pregnancies of any location with 17.9%.
In contrast urban areas had only 11.8% of adolescent pregnancies.
Perhaps this is a reflection of the lack of education or entertainment available in rural areas.
This 17.9% Rural pregnancy rate of 15-19 year olds is shockingly high.
There is a higher percentage of women between 15-19 who have begun childbearing in rural areas.
There is a lower percentage of women between 15-19 who have begun childbearing in urban areas.
The average rate of pregnancy among all women is lower than rural areas but higher than in urban areas.
"The rate of pregnancy is higher in the Rural with 17.9%, followed by Total with 15.4% and Urban with 11.8%."
We can see that the pregnancy rate in rural areas is generally higher than the rest of the examples.
"Total isn't stated as to total of what, in the world or which area?"
Total also isn't the total from Rural and Urban percentages added up so clearly we cannot conclude a total of what.
The rural increase may be due to uneducated and poorly advanced nations.
Urban people tend to have less children as the factors are different for each example.
A horizontal bar chart entitled “In most regions more women obtained wages than men” showing the Regions on the y-axis and “Female wage and salaried ratio / male wage and salaried workers ratio (% of female/male employment)” on the x-axis from 0.0 to 1.2 with a increment of 0.1.
I see that in South Asia and sub-saharan Africa there's a negative trend about wages compared to men ones.
"The pattern present in here is that in the Europe or generally in the west area of the world the discrepancy is almost null, but for example in North America and Latin America, there's a legit tendency of improvement of status of wages for Women compared to Men."
"In North America, the average wages of women is 1.0963 times higher than that of men."
"The average wages of women is greater than that of men in Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, Europe, and Central Africa and East Asia and Pacifics whereas the wages of women are less as compared to men in Subsaharan Africa and South Asia and is least for Sub-Saharan Asia whereas compared to men the average wage of women is only 69%."
"The lowest amount is on regions like South Africa and East Asia that have less rights for women, and are paid less."
"In countries with democracy, East Asia and Pacific (Japan, Australia..) have an amount over 1 maybe because women have more rights there, and this also applies to other continents."
"As you approach the regions of America, woman have highest wages compared to the other side of the world."
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have significantly lower female wage and salaried ratio / male wage and salaried workers ratio than other regions.
Countries in the Americas have the highest female wage and salaried ratio / male wage and salaried workers ratio.
Women in North America are more likely to be able to hold a salary than all other countries.
Women in Sub-Saharan Africa are less likely to be able to gain paid work and a salary.
Western cultures provide more opportunities for women.
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa seem to be the only regions to have much lower female employment.
"In all other regions, the ratio is almost 1, and in North America, Latin America and Caribbean there is almost 10% more female employment that men employment."
"Except for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, women earn more than men."
In the more developed countries there rates of wages for women are higher.
"From this, we can conclude that women are increasingly valued in the labor market in the more developed countries."
The region where women appeared to obtain more wages than men the most is North America.
The region where women appeared to obtain less than men is Sub-Saharan Africa.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the lowest percent of female to male employment ratio.
North America is the region with the highest percent of female to male employment ratio.
Only Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia go below a ratio of 1.
"Although Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the lowest value, North Africa has a pretty high female wage and salaried ratio / male wage and salaried workers ratio."
"In seven of the 9 regions, women receive higher wages than men."
This chart could suggest that workplace discimination is not as severe in the West as some people argue.
A horizontal bar chart entitled “China leads in government support for innovation” that plots percentage agreement with the statement “Government drives most innovation” by Country.
Country is plotted on the vertical y-axis.
The percentage agreement is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.
35% of people in China agree that their government drives most of their innovation.
This is more than in any other country.
"In Asian countries, more people agree that the government drives innovation, though it is still a small percentage for some."
Countries in areas of the world other than Asia disagree more that their government drives innovation.
European countries seem to have the least agreement with the statement that their government drives innovation.
More people in China agree with the statement than do people in the US.
People in Germany agree with the statement the least.
People in South Korea agree second only to China.
Eastern countries seems to have a higher percentage of agreement with the statement.
"All countries do not agree very strongly with the statement, even China."
Only 5 countries have 10% or more agreement.
The average of agreement is very low.
People in Asia tend to agree more that their countries are supportive of innovation than do people from Western countries and Europe.
Asian countries seem to have higher agreement with innovation being more driven with government support.
"In the lowest end, European and South American countries don't agree that Innovation is driven by government support."
Oceania and African countries lies between in terms of the agreement with the statement.
Asian countries and Australia have better government support than the north-american and european countries.
"This data may be biased, since governments like China are not a democracy, and can alter the perception of their people as they please, so 35% agreement is not a confident statement."
China is the highest in support for government innovation while Germany is the lowest.
The graph implies that Asian countries are more likely to have high levels of support for innovation by the government.
There is a very sharp drop of government support for innovation between China and Germany.
China leads in government support for innovation is mostly recognized in asian countries.
The highest support countries is still pretty low (35% of agreement with the statement).
Countries listed that are on the Asian continent agree the most with the idea that government drives most innovation.
Countries listed from all other continents have less than 10% in agreement.
"The headline says that China has the most government support for innovation, but this is not what the data says: the data only says that people agree with this statement."
A horizontal bar chart entitled “The most emoji-crazed countries” that plots the percentage of Comments with an emoji by Country.
The Country is plotted on the vertical y-axis.
The Comments with an emoji is plotted on the horizontal x-axis by percentage.
Europeans use emojis more than people from other continents.
Finland uses nearly twice as many emojis as Korea.
"The only African representative is Tanzania, which uses the least emojis."
Brazil is the only South American country to make the chart with 37% commenting with an emoji.
Many European countries use the a lot of emojis possibly due to the nature of multiple languages being present in the continent: emojis a great way to ensure the receiver knows the intent and mood being conveyed in the message.
"Women tend to use emojis more than men, so possibly these countries have a higher number of women texting compared to the latter half."
"The countries that use the fewest emojis are North American, East Asian and South American."
This could be due to texts being generally short or possibly the use of more acronyms such as LOL or ILY so they may replace emojis with those.
Europe is the continent most likely to use emojis.
Europeans have more vacation time allotted to them than North Americans.
Perhaps this is in relation to work leisure balance.
Europeans are also more likely to speak multiple languages and perhaps have social media friends in a language they do not speak.
Using an emoji would result in more universal communications.
"Australia and Brazil, and Russia and Italy has the rate of emoji use even when having a very different population levels."
"Korea and Tanzania have just 10 million less population than, for example, Italy, yet they are on the bottom of the list, and this could mean that it doesnt matter how much big in population a country is but also how banned chats and message applications are, countries with more liberty tend to use more emojis."
European countries use more comments with emojis than the rest of the world.
Very few countries have emojis in over 50% of comments.
"We can see that Finland is by far the most ""emoji-crazed"" country."
"Then, the countries that followed Finland, have not very wide differences in the percentage between them."
"However, the least ""emoji-crazed"" country, Tanzania, has a huge difference in percentage in comparison with Finland (10% versus 63%)."
A horizontal bar chart entitled “The most emoji-crazed countries” that plots the percentage of Comments with an emoji by Country.
Finland is the country that most frequently uses emojis in their comments.
This emoji is a popular emoji.
Countries with high levels of technology are able to use this emoji frequently.
European countries seem to frequently use this emoji.
The lowest country is the only African country.
Brazil and Australia have the same amounts of comments with emojis.
"Tanzania is the biggest outlier, with less than 1/3 emoji use than Korea, the next up on the list."
"Similarly, list-topper Finland uses emojis by quite a large margin of 13% compared to the next down on the list."
"The rest of the list is much more even, with only 18 percentage points between the second highest and second lowest."
"Emojis are generally more popular in Europe than the rest of the world, with the top seven countries listed all being in Europe, with the exception of Russia which is partly in Europe and partly in Asia."
The most emoji crazed country is Finland with 63% comments with emojis.
The least emoji crazed country is Korea with 10% comments with emojis.
"Finland is the happiest country in the world, meaning their society's wellbeing is high, meaning more people can afford phones and use emojis."
Tanzania is a third world country and not many can afford a phone.
We can see a graph of the most emoji-crazed countries.
The countries are sorted from highest percentage to the lowest.
The research has been done of the hands up emoji and the statistic has been based on it.
The first country is Finland leading with 63%.
"It is followed by France, UK, Germany, Italy and Russia."
We can see that Increase is no more than 2-5 on Average.
Tanzania is 53% behind Finland which indicates this emoji is not so often used.
The more advanced the country is the higher the percentage of emoji use is.
A horizontal bar chart entitled “Countries ranked by Netflix download speeds” that plots Average download speed during prime viewing hours by Country.
Country is plotted on the vertical y-axis.
The Average during prime viewing hours is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.
Belgium has the highest Netflix download speeds during prime time.
Costa Rica has the lowest Netflix download speeds during prime time.
Denmark and Sweden have the same Netflix download speeds during prime time at 2.89.
Chile and Mexico has the same Netflix download speeds during prime time at 2.61.
"Belgium has the highest Netflix download speeds out of a group of 28 countries (some western, some hispanic, and some asian/african for example)."
"Belgium's download speed is 4.15 Mbps , second place is Luxembourg at 4.11 Mbps, and thirdly is Netherlands at 4.02 Mbps."
"Some of the fastest download speeds, during prime viewing hours, belong to solely European countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, etc."
"The United States is at 15th place with 3.26 Mbps download speed, unlike the slowest county, Costa Rica, at 1.83 Mbps."
"Latin American countries exhibit much lower download speeds most likely due to poor government funding, massive poverty, lack of resources, etc."
"Size of the country is not a key factor in estimating results since USA, UK, and Australia aren't top 3."
Resources and poverty though are major factors.
"Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands have the most Netflix download speeds in peak hours, averaging about 4 Mbps, while Jamaica, Ecuador, and Costa Rica have the lowest Netflix download speeds at peak hours, averaging about 2 Mbps."
European countries have the fastest Netflix download speed.
"It's visible that in richer countries, people benefit from faster downloads than those who live in countries with inferior per capita incomes."
European countries top the chart.
American countries fill up the bottom places.
The three lowest download speed averages are below half the value of Belgium.
All European countries show a minimum of 3 Mbps in their respective averages.
Both Canada and the US are the only countries in America that surpass the 3 Mbps barrier.
"The lowest download speed average is from Costa Rica, at 1.83 Mbps."
The horizontal bar chart shows that Belgium has the best download speed of any country on the graph with 4.15mbps.
Belgium has the highest download speed with 4.15mbps compared to Costa Rica with the lowest at 1.83mbps.
There is a clear distinction between economically rich and poor countries: the richer countries have higher download speed on average than the poorer and less developed countries (such as Ecuador and Jamaica).
Northern European countries on the whole had the fastest download speeds.
Nothern-American and European countries have better downloading speed than South-American and Latin countries.
Belgium has the highest download speed.
South America has got the lowest download speed.
European countries tend to have the best download speed.
Belgium has the most fasted download speeds.
European countries generally have faster download speeds.
South American countries has slowest download speeds.
Belgium has the fastest Netflix download speed.
Costa Rica has the slowest Netflix download speed.
Countries in Europe have a faster Netflix download speed.
Countries in South America have a slower Netflix download speed.
Countries in North America and Oceania have an average Netflix download speed.
The slow Netflix download speed in South America might be related to bad or old Internet infrastructures.
Belgium has fastest Netflix download speed is 4.15 Mbps.
Costa Rica has the slowest Netflix download speed at 1.83 Mbps.
The average Netflix download speed is around 3 Mbps.
A horizontal bar chart entitled “US adult average daily media consumption” that plots the Hours of usage per day by media type.
The media type is plotted on the vertical y-axis.
The Hours of usage per day is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.
US adults use TV much more than other media devices.
Radio is still at second place even with the coming of smartphones.
"US adults almost never use their Apple watches, maybe because they are not fitness people and they don't like to exercise."
The difference between the hours spent on the TV and the hours spent on other devices is very large.
The hours on the TV are more than the sum of the hours on every other device.
"US adults spend very little time on their tablets and PCs, but this is surprising because lots of people probably work using a PC."
The highest media consumption for US adults is the TV.
The lowest media consumption for US adults is the Apple Watch.
There is no media consumption for US adults on the Apple Watch.
Adults in US spend more time consuming media content on TV.
US adults spends little or no hours consuming media on Apple watch.
Radio is considered as an alternative to TV in media consumption by US adults.
There is a large variation in how US adults consumes media.
"Most US adults consume media on TV, followed by Radio, then Smartphone, then PC, then Tabelt, and finally the Apple Watch."
The TV has the highest amount of usage a day.
Apple Watch receives the lowest amount of usage a day.
PC and tablet receive a similar amount of usage a day.
"I assume that this is an older graph or that the sample was on the older side, as I would assume younger people used their smartphones more than 1 hour a day and listen to the radio less."
"On average, US adults do not use an Apple watch."
"Taken together, the average US adult uses different media roughly 9-10 hours a day."
No smartwatches other than the Apple watch were evaluated.
"I can observe that TV had the most hours of usage of all in the daily average of media consumption, followed by Radio, Smartphone, PC, Tablet, and Apple Watch."
TV is the most used media in USA.
"PC, Tablet and Apple Watch are the least used ones."
"US adults don't use Apple Watches, at least not on a daily basis."
"TV continues to be the most popular form of media consumption, even with the rise of mobile and home computer technology."
"TV is 2.5 times as popular as its nearest competitor, the radio."
"The Apple Watch gets the least amount of usage, with no usage at all shown."
"This is likely because people use smartwatches for activities other than consuming media, while for much of the other tech it is the primary use - indeed, the sole use of TVs and radios, which are much more passive forms of consumption by their nature."
"TV as a media type is higher than other media types, followed by the radio, and then the smartphones, down to Apple Watch which is 0 and is the lowest."
TV is by far the most popular media past time.
"Considering that radio is the second most popular media consumption format, it is possible that Americans prefer media that they can listen to rather than rely on reading."
A vertical bar chart entitled “How do pill purchase patterns vary by buyer business types?” with a subtitle “Number of transactions made by buyers in each of the three categories below across 2006-2014”.
The Number of Records is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 1500.
"The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2014, for each business type: Practitioners (red), Retail Pharmacies (yellow), and Chain Pharmacies (green)."
Practitioners purchased an average much lower number of pills than Retail Pharmacies or Chain Pharmacies.
"Both Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies have raised their purchases from 2006-2013, but have lowered the number a little by 2014."
"Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies have had a very similar development in their purchases, while Practitioners' is very different."
Practitioners had lowered their purchases by 2008 and then raised them abruptly by 2014.
"Practitioners have raised a lot their purchases throughout the years, while the other two maintained about the same amount."
Over the years the Practitioners transaction rates varied a lot.
The Retail and Chain Pharmacies had a somewhat consistent transaction rates.
In 2008 the practitioners had a very low number of transactions.
Over the years the Chain and Retail Pharmacies buyers had a similar levels of transactions.
The year 2014 had the highest transaction period among all buyers.
"Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies have mostly linear pill purchase patterns, while Practitioners vary widely."
"The Practitioner's lowest number of transactions has been 2008, while the highest point was 2014."
The Practitioner's pill purchase pattern was highly varying while Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies are mostly stable.
Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies have a similar graphical trend.
"Retail Pharmacies and Chain Pharmacies both have a gradual, increasing trend."
Practitioners have a large spike in between 2010 and 2011.
Practitioners didn't transact as much as the other two before the year 2012.
There is a considerable amount of variation between the years 2006 and 2010 for the transactions of Practitioners.
There is a clear preference in where people buy their prescriptions towards Retail and Chain pharmacies.
There is a smaller amount of people who are getting their prescriptions from Practitioners.
There is little difference in preference between Retail and Chain Pharmacies.
"Retail and Chain Pharmacies have a similar grow and curve, the climb maintains until 2013, in 2014 they had a declining line registering less records than the previous year."
"Practitioners has it's own curve with some ups and downs, less consistent, starting to consistent grow in 2009 Until 2014."
Practitioners also registered the highest Number of records of all three in 2014.
Chain pharmacies have had a relatively stable number of pill transactions from 2008-2014 noticing a small increase (10-20) every year apart from a small (10-20) decrease in 2014.
Retail pharmacies have had a relatively stable number of pill transactions from 2008-2014 noticing a small increase (10-20)  every year apart from a small (10-20) decrease in 2014.
Practitioners have had a relatively stable number of pill transactions from 2006-2010 noticing small (30-60) to medium (100-150) increases and decreases during that time.
Practitioners noticed a large increase in pill transactions in the years 2011(from 800 to 1200 pills) and 2012 (from 1200 to 1400) and stabilized in the years 2013 and 2014.
While retail and chain pharmacies both had a drop in pill transactions in 2014 Practitioners even had a small increase.
The Practitioners growth is very unsteady.
Practitioners did not buy as many pills in 2008.
Practitioners bought the most pills in 2014.
Retail pharmacies bought the most pills in 2013.
Retail pharmacies bought the least amount of pills in 2006.
Chain pharmacies bought the most pills in 2013.
Chain pharmacies bought the least amount of pills in 2006 after 2013.
Chain and Retail pharmacies experienced a drop in 2014.
"The biggest growth of transactions belongs to Practitioners, doubling up twice in 8 years (750 records in 2006, to 1450 in 2014)."
In 2006 Practitioners had the lowest number transactions than the other two.
In 2010 to 2011 Practitioners had a 400 gain of transactions.
"Retail and Chain Pharmacies have a similar, steady growth."
"However, the number of records have declined for both of them in 2014."
That means Practitioners are becoming more popular than Retail and Chain Pharmacies.
The Practitioners seem to have both the lowest and the highest number of records.
"Both the Retail pharmacies and the Chain pharmacies have an increase in amount of records up until 2014, where it goes down by a bit."
The Practitioners number of records throughout the years is the most irregular.
"From what I can observe, it seems like both the Retail and Chain pharmacies have a constant and regular amount of records."
A vertical bar chart entitled “COVID-19 mortality rate by age” that plots the mortality rate by age.
The mortality rate is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 15%.
"Age is plotted on the horizontal x-axis in bins: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+."
"Between the ages of 10 and 39, you are only within 0.2% mortality rage for COVID-19."
"Between 40 to 49 years old, it doubles to 0.4%."
"Between the ages of 50 to 59, it basically triples to 1.3%."
"After that between 60-69, we're seeing a 3.6% mortality rate."
"Between 70-79, there's an 8% mortality rate."
"Once you hit 80+, it's at a whopping 14.8%."
"This still does not compare to the mortality rate of something that's even more common like heart disease/heart failure that can climb between 15-50%, even coronary heart disease with, which according to google, one-third of all deaths in subjects over age 35."
"I don't know what the mortality rate of that is, but it sure is a lot more people than COVID-19."
"The highest COVID-19 mortality rate is in the 80+ age range, while the lowest mortality rate is in 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, sharing the same result."
COVID-19 mortality rate does not linearly correspond to the demographic age.
We can observe that the mortality rate is higher starting at 50 years old due to many complications prior.
"As we decrease the age, we also decrease the values in mortality by a lot, almost to none."
By looking at the graph one can state that under 50 years of age the mortality associated to COVID-19 is really low and slightly increases between the age of 50 and 60.
"Mortality starts to increase and become significant after the age of 60, becoming really serious after 80 years of age."
It's safe to state that mortality rates and age are directly proportional.
People above 50 years old are at least three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than people younger than 50.
People more than 80 years old and the most vulnerable population.
People more than 80 years old are almost twice as likely to die than any other group.
"Among Chinese people, mortality rate increases with age."
"All age categories of those under 40 have a mortality rate of 0.2% but this doubles in the forties age-group, and thereafter increases markedly with each decade of age."
"The mortality rate increases with age, especially around 40-49 years and upwards."
This relates to the decrease of immunity and the increase of co-morbidity with age.
The mortality rate increases exponentially with older people.
There is no difference in the mortality rate in the range between the age of 10 and 39.
The range of ages between 60 and 80+ are more affected by COVID-19.
"The chart clearly shows that the greater the age, the greater the death rate of COVID-19, while people over 80 experience the highest mortality rate."
A grouped bar chart that slows Classification accuracy (%) on the Training set and Test set by Parameter configuration.
The Classification accuracy (%) is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 65 to 90.
"The Parameter configuration is plotted on the horizontal x-axis for the following configurations: C, N, V, C+N, C+V, N+V, C+N+V."
"We can see that C+N+V has the higher accuracy, meanwhile C has the lowest accuracy."
In every representation the training set's bar has the higher accuracy compared to test set's bar.
"From highest to lowest for training set's bar we have: C+N+V, C+N, N+V, C+V, N, V, C. From highest to lowest for test set's bar we have:  C+N+V, C+N, N+V, C+V, N, C, V."
In general seems that the training set gives better results than the test set.
The result of adding C+N is quite better than the result of them alone.
"The same happens with C+V, the performance is a little better but not that much."
"Otherwise, N+V is really better than the result from them alone."
The overall of C+N+V is better than any of them alone.
"Single configurations induce less accuracy, the result is a lower classification %."
"When configurations are grouped in 2, the classification accuracy increases, When all the configurations are combined into one, the highest classification is obtained."
Training sets are always more accurate.
Test sets are always less accurate.
The biggest gap between test and training is in the C+V combination.
"N, V and C+N have the lowest gap between test and training."
Training set accuracy is always greater than test set accuracy.
"Combining individual parameters (in twos, or threes) is always more accurate than any individual parameter."
The accuracy is higher for the training set.
The accuracy is lower for the test set.
The configuration C+N+V has the highest accuracy in both sets.
The configuration V has the lowest accuracy in the training set.
The configuration C has the lowest accuracy in the test set.
In all the configurations the training set has a higher classification accuracy than the test set.
The more elements we add to the configuration the higher the classification accuracy becomes.
The configuration with the highest accuracy is C+N+V.
"The Test sets are generally slightly lower than Training sets, for any parameter configuration."
There is no lower than 69% accuracy in any set with any parameter.
The greatest difference between Training and Test sets is when only parameter C is applied.
Parameter N seems to hold most accurate classification than the other parameters uncombined.
The combined configurations are the sum of the corresponding parameters as shown in the graph.
"Though, the graph does not show accuracies below 65%, so if one considers the accuracy starting at 0%, the combined parameters do not really showcase a sum."
"More like, they show as sum of accuracies above 65%."
The test results are routinely lower than the trining results.
"When C, N, and V work together their scores are comparatively higher"
The classification accuracy rate is consistently higher for the training set than the test set.
The parameter configurations that produce the highest classification accuracy rates are C+N and C+N+V.
The parameter configurations that produce the lowest classification accuracy rates are C and V.
The classification accuracy percentage of the test set tends to be lower than the training set one.
Both sets (test set and training set) classification accuracy percentages have a tendency to increase in relation to x-axis from left to right.
The classification accuracy percentage tends to be higher in pair parameter configurations than the single ones.
Trio parameter configuration C+N+V has the highest classification accuracy percentage in both sets.
The classification accuracy percentage of the parameter configurations that includes N tends to be higher than the ones that don't have N.
"A vertical bar chart entitled “Legal definition of an alcoholic beverage (% pure alcohol by volume), as reported by countries, 2008."
The Number of countries is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 80.
"The Minimum alcohol content is plotted on the horizontal x-axis for the following groups: <1, 1-1.99, 2-2.99, 3-3.99, 4-4.99, 5<=, and None."
There are many more countries who have None minimum percentage of alcohol to define alcoholic a beverage.
"Minimum percentage of alcohol is usually very low, below 1%."
"In any case where there is a definition for alcoholic beverage, it is below 5%."
The lowest minimum percentage considered to be alcoholic is lower than 1% of alcohol in the beverage.
There seems to be no country who set this limit between 4 and 4.99%.
Around  68 countries have not decided what the minimum alcohol content would be to identify as an alcoholic beverage.
"Secondly, around 42 countries believe <1 % alcohol content qualifies as an alcoholic beverage."
15 countries believed 1-1.99% alcohol content meant it was an adult only drink.
10 countries believed 2-2.99% qualified as an alcoholic beverage.
"Last but not least, around 3 countries believed that 3-3.99 qualified as an alcoholic beverage, which is surprising considering that some people can become intoxicated from beers with 2% alcohol content."
This could mean that a child might be drinking a 2.5% alcohol drink and the parents might not be concerned over their child's cognitive development?
"Even more alarming is that most countries don't have a specific, enforceable standard, and this could potentially allow private companies to get away with selling alcoholic drinks as non-alcoholic."
"This can happen with fermented drinks, which can sometimes be purchased without showing an ID."
"The mode of the distribution is ""None"" Most countries who have a definition have it to less than 1% alcohol content."
No country defines it by 4-4.99%.
"Around half the countries have ""None"" as a definition."
Most countries consider no minimum alcohol content for the legal definition of alcoholic beverages.
"We can notice by comparing the size of the None column and the addition of the other columns that on average, half of the countries in the world don't have a legal definition of an alcoholic beverage."
Most of the countries that consider it have a percentage below 1%.
The other categories are in decreasing order with the exception of 5%<=.
"The 5%<= category is more than the 3-3,99% category but below the 2-2,99% category."
This suggest that the rest of countries which have an above 5% have more diverse percentage.
"With this graphic, we notice that most countries that have an legal definition are pretty specific about the percentage."
"A large number of countries - 40+ have their definition of minimum alcohol content as ""less than 1% alcohol volume"", while other countries have varied definitions such as percentage alcohol volume between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, for about 15, 9, 3 and 0 countries, respectively."
About 7 countries have a broad definition of equal to or less than 5% alcohol volume constituting an alcoholic beverage.
"However, 67 countries do not actually have a legal definition at all."
Most countries (almost 70) do not have a legal minimum content for the definition of an alcoholic beverage.
"For the countries that have a legal definition, slightly more than 40 have defined the <1 a the minimum alcohol content."
"As the concentration rises, fewer countries define an alcoholic beverage by that concentration."
Then again at slightly less than 5% the number of countries rises again at less than 10.
Most countries dont have a minimum alcohol content in definition of alcohol beverage.
More than 40 countries take <1 % as an alcohol beverage.
No country has 4-4.99% in their legal definition of alcohol beverage.
The most countries don't have a legal minimum of an alcohol content to consider a drink as an alcoholic beverage.
Over 40 countries define that an alcoholic beverage must have at least 1% of a pure alcohol.
"Zero countries define that an alcoholic beverage must have at least 4-4,99% of alcohol."
The mode of countries' do not have a definition.
No countries have 4-4.99 as minimum alcohol content.
"Of the countries that do have a definition, the most common is <1 percent which gradually decreases as the alcohol content increases."
A vertical bar chart entitled “Percent births delivered by C-Section by income in 2006/2007”.
The % of births delivered by C-section is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 25.
"The income is plotted on the horizontal x-axis for the following categories: Poorest (4.1), Poorer (5.2), Middle (9.8), Richer (16.5), Richest (31.7)."
The richer have better opportunities than poor people.
Poor people don't get the same level health care and might die because of that.
The richest have the highest percent of births by C-section (31.7%).
The poorest have the lowest percent of births by C-section (4.1%)
In 2006/2007 there was a positive correlation between wealth and birth by C-section.
The richest of the population accounted for 31.7% of C-sections in comparison to 4.1 percent in the poorest of society .
This suggests there is a poverty gap in access to and education in birthing choices and healthcare
The richer you are the more likely you are to have a baby delivered by C-section in 2006/2007.
There is an exponential rise in babies delivered by C-section as you move along the society ladder in 2006/2007.
The richest are 6x more likely to have a baby delivered by C-section than the poorest in 2006/2007.
Richer people are more likely to have less children hence there is greater delivery by C-section than poorer people.
The richest people are almost twice as likely to have a baby delivered by C-section than the richer and 3x more likely than the middle class.
"In the Richest category the percentage of births delivered by C-sections reaches above 30% and in the Rich category is already diminished by half, reaching 15%."
"In middle category is about 10%, while in poorer and poorest category is around 5%."
This may link to the possibility for the Richest category to reach and afford a better and top quality health system.
Richest category has the highest % of births delivered by C-section.
The poorest category has the lowest % of births delivered by C-Section.
There is an increase in % of C-section births as the categories have a higher income.
"Since healthcare isn't free in America I assume it costs more to get the C-section, so the rich were able to get the C-section because they could afford it, or they were treated differently."
"The poorest people have the lowest rate of C-sections done, probably because they couldn't afford it or they were treated differently"
In years 2006/2007 the most C-section births were given by richest and the least by poorest.
The trend is that people with more money gradually increase births given by C-section.
"The more financially stable you are, the higher the percentage of c-sections births."
This is an exponential increase.
"Alternatively, the poorer you are, the higher the percentage of natural births."
"During those two years, we notice that people with less wealth are less likely to have their births delivered by C-section."
"On the other hand, people with more wealth do have increasingly more chances of getting their births delivered by C-section, with a discrepancy of around 27% between the Richest group and the Poorest, and almost a doubled increased chance between the Richest and the Richer."
A horizontal bar chart entitled “Who is Selling the Most Pain Pills in Kentucky?” which shows the Pharmacy Name on the y-axis and the Total Quantity of Opioids on the x-axis from 0K to 1600K with an increment of 200K.
The total number of pain pills sold is over 3 million.
"The pharmacy selling the most opioids in Kentucky is Rite Aid with 1,435,064."
"There are only two pharmacies selling over the million mark, they include Rite Aid and Walgreens."
"The pharmacy selling the least number of opioids in Kentucky is Med Care Pharmacy LLC with 47,207."
There are 10 pharmacies in Kentucky that sell opioids.
Pharmacy named Rite Aid was selling the most opioids in Kentucky from 2006 to 2014.
Pharmacy named Med Care Pharmacy was selling the least opioids in Kentucky from 2006 to 2014.
"There are two pharmacies that sold more than 1 milion of opioids, and this is Rite Aid and Walgreens."
"Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS dominated in selling opioids in Kentucky."
There's almost a monopoly of the sales by the first three sellers.
If you add all the sales from the 4th biggest to the last it won't even reach the 3rd highest.
Rite Aid is the biggest seller for pain pills in Kentucky.
Med Care Pharmacy sold the least pills from the 10 companies included in the chart.
"Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS seem to dominate the market."
"The main players in the market are RITE AID, WALGREEN and CVS, all the other pharmacies are far behind them."
The data was collected over the course of 9 years.
"If we consider the RITE AID score alone (1,435,064 tablets sold), this gives us about 160,000 tablets a year in Kentucky alone."
Rite Aid has the highest number of opioids sold in Kentucky.
Med Care Pharmacy LLC has the lowest sales number.
Rite Aid sold the greatest Total Quantity of Opioids.
Med Care Pharmacy LLC sold the least Total Quantity of Opioids.
Rite Aid and Walgreens are major distributors of pain killers in Kentucky.
Rite Aid sold the greatest total quantity of opioids in Kentucky and Med Care Pharmacy sold the least amount of opioids in Kentucky.
Larger more well known pharmacies such as Rite Aid Walgreens and CVS sell more opioids in Kentucky while smaller lesser known pharmacies sells less.
Stand alone pharmacies sell more Opioids than those in grocery stores or small outlet pharmacies.
The pharmacy that sold the greatest total quantity of opioids is Rite Aid.
The pharmacy that sold the least total quantity of opioids is Med Care Pharmacy LLC.
"The top 4 sellers are all big name brands (Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, and Kroger)."
With the notable exception of Kmart the rest on the list seem to be more local pharmacies.
The well-known brands sell the most since they are the most likely to have more stores for people to shop in.
These are multimillion dollar companies that have many stores with access to these opiods while other local brands don't have this level of distribution.
Rite Aid sold the most opioids and Med Care Pharmacy LLC the least.
Rite Aid sold the greatest Total Quantity of Opioids.
Med Care Pharmacy LLC sold the least Total Quantity of Opioids.
The three most-popular pharmacies have enormous predominance (over 300K) in sales over other pharmacies.
Rite Aid and Walgreens together have sold more than half of all Opioids sold in Kentucky.
"Additionally, more power implies more efficiency and vice-versa."
People tend to shop at the most popular and well-known pharmacies.
"Rite Aid sold the most amount of opioids, and Med Care Pharmacy LLC sold the least amount."
"The top 3 pharmacies - Rite Aid, Walgreens, and CVS seems to be occupying most of the opioid drug market in Kentucky."
"There is a large gap between CVS and Kroger, with CVS selling almost 3 times the amount Kroger sold."
Pharmacies that sold less than Badger Acquisition have insignificant differences in the amount sold.
"Rite Aid, Walgreens, and CVS occupy the largest opioid drug market, so they may also occupy a large market in other types of drugs too."
A horizontal bar chart entitled “Binge watching is for loners” which shows the percentage of the population that binge watches either Alone or With Partner by country.
"Although most countries represented tend to binge watch shows alone, people from Asia are much more likely to binge watch shows alone."
"In Spanish speaking countries, people are more likely to binge watch shows with their partners."
"Japanese, Chinese and South Koreans are those who binge watch mostly alone."
Mexican and Spanish people binge watch slightly more with partners.
"Asian countries, European countries and North America tend to correlate with the statement that binge watching is for loners."
This could be due to the individualistic nature of people.
"Many in these countries grow up to live in small single bedroom apartments and value career over relationships hence, watching shows alone."
East Asian countries in particular have the highest rates probably due to the popularity of anime and small single bedroom houses.
"Whereas warmer, more ""family oriented"" countries including India and South America tend to show equal amounts of binge watching alone and with family."
"This could be due to the bigger community connections in these countries (more festivals, more dancing, more parties etc.)."
These countries also tend to have an overpopulation problem and larger families.
"We can conclude from the bar graph that binge watching isn't always just for loners, it vastly depends on the country of origin and respective traditions/lifestyles."
"In Asian countries for example, the vast majority of binge watchers are single, while people that have partners don't binge watch that much."
"On the opposite side, Latin countries like Spain, Mexico and Chile have more-or-less equal distributions of binge watchers."
Mexico even has more partner binge-watchers than alone binge-watchers.
Most countries binge-watch alone.
Latin countries prefer to binge-watch with a partner.
It looks like the relation between binge watching changes according to whether or not someone is watching alone or with a partner.
"Generally, people in most places binge watch a lot more when they are alone than when they are in the company of another person."
"The biggest gap is found in Japan, where 80% of binge watching occurs when people are alone, against a 21% of accompanied watchers."
"However, Spain and Mexico experience the opposite phenomenon: binge watching happens more when people have company than when they are alone."
"The percentages sometimes add up to over one hundred, so it can be inferred that some people who watch alone also watch with partners."
"It appears that the more people in a country prefer to watch alone, the less they watch with partners."
"Japan has the highest alone watching rate and the lowest partner watching rate, while Mexico has the lowest alone watching rate and the highest watching with partner rate."
"In most countries, the percentage adds up to more than 100%, meaning that there are people who binge watch both alone and with partner."
"In most countries, binge watching is preferred alone."
"Japan, South Korea and China have the highest rates of binge watching alone, perhaps due to the anime trends that are very popular there."
"The top few countries are all Asian, this might be because due to the restrictions on international sites (such as Netflix), they are encouraged to watch their own sites."
"The first few being Asian might also be because it is not considered a negative to watch TV alone, whereas in places like USA watching lots of TV might have a negative connotation."
The top countries are also quite wealthy meaning the average individual can afford their own TV set or computer.
A vertical bar chart entitled “Lethal Force: Number of people who have died as a result of police action or while in police custody in South Africa”.
The Number of people is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 800.
The Years are plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 1998-99 to 2010-11.
The highest number of people to be abused by the South African police force was between 2010-2011 with around 800 victims.
The year with the fewest number of people was 2002-2003 with an estimated 330 victims.
"After the years 1998-1999, where around 590 individuals suffered, the abuse steadily declined up until 2003."
It remained relatively low between 2002 and 2005.
"After that, it steadily increased to around 605 victims in 2009, ultimately reaching their highest 800 victims between 2010-2011."
"In contrast, the American cops killed 215 white people in 2020 in comparison to the whopping 457 white people dead in 2017."
"Surprisingly, 223 black people were killed in 2017 and only 111 recorded this year in 2020."
The number of people who died as a result of police action or while in police custody has decreased from 1999-2003.
"In 2004-2005, the numbers have shown a slight increase from previous years but then lowers again in 2006."
After 2007 the numbers have increased steadily surpassing the numbers from 10 years before.
The chart shows more people have died by police action in the 2010-2011 range than any other year range.
The number of people who have died by police action has shown that South Africa has either a growing violence problem or a policing problem.
The number of deaths peaked in 2010-2011.
The amount of deaths was fairly stable between 2000 and 2007 The amount of deaths was trending downwards from 1998-to around 2007 but seems to be trending back up after 2007.
The lowest year for deaths was 2002-2003.
The number of people who have died due to lethal police force has been rising for the past 8 years.
The chart shows the number of people killed and years when that happened.
It varies over the years and starts to increase in the 2010-2011 period.
The number of deaths have increased significantly since the 2005-2006 period.
Deaths reached a record high in the 2010-2011 period.
Deaths were at an all-time low in the 2002-2003 period.
Deaths were steadily decreasing over time since the 1997-1998 period until before 2003-2004.
"After 2003-2004, deaths have spiked again."
The number of people dying as a result of lethal force (consequence of police action/custody) dipped at the beginning of the 21st century but has returned to and surpassed end-of-20th century levels for the past couple of years of the chart shown.
The deaths had started with a descending trend.
"Around 2002-2006, the numbers of deaths had fallen considerably lower than the other years."
"After 2006, there has been a general rise in the number of deaths every year."
"2010-2011 saw an ""exponential"" rise in deaths in comparison to other periods."
2008-2009 was the first period with a new record in deaths since 1998-1999.
The highest number of people that died is around 800 in 2010-2011.
The lowest number of people that died is around 300 in 2002-2003.
The number of people who died as a result of police action seemed to be falling between '98 and '03 however after 03 the number begins to increase.
"The number of people who died in '10-'11 is the highest number in the data set, it also shows the highest increase rate from the previous year."
Twice as many people were killed (per year) in '10-'11 than in the years '01-'05.
A vertical grouped bar chart entitled “Decrease in Mortality Rate of Adult Males and Females Over a Quarter Century”.
The y-axis plots the Adult Mortality Rate (per 1000 Adults) from 0 to 600 with an increment of 50.
The x-axis shows repeating bar-pairs for the years 1990 and 2015 by country and demographic (male or female).
There is an overall decrease in the mortality rate within all countries.
"Rwanda has seen the biggest decrease, possibly due to improvements in the country's politics and social relations."
In Rwanda the mortality rate of males and females has greatly decreased.
Overall the mortality rate of males is higher than the rate of females.
Decrease in mortality rate of both genders can be explained by increase of human prosperity and development of medicine and technology.
The lowest mortality rate in 2015 for both males and females was in China.
Rwanda had the largest decrease in the mortality rate for both males and females and yet still has the highest male mortality rate.
Rwanda has seen the biggest decrease in its mortality rate for both male and female (60 and 65%) between 1990 and 2015 but its rate in 2015 are still the highest of the countries presented in the data (more than 200 for male and around 180 for female).
In India and Bangladesh female mortality has decrease of a higher percentage (around 40%) when male mortality has only decrease by almost half the percentage (23%).
"On the other hand, in the United State female mortality has only decreased by 11% when male mortality has decreased by the double amount with 22%."
China presents similar decrease rate of 36% for male and 38% for female.
Rwanda has the highest decrease in mortality rate and the United States has the lowest decrease in mortality rate.
Every country's adult mortality rates for both males and for females have decreased over the course of 25 years from 1990 to 2015.
"For all countries except the USA, this is more marked among females than males."
"In the USA, this is the reverse, and the mortality rate among males has dropped at double the rate than among females."
"Of the countries shown, Rwanda's death rate was particularly high for both males and females, but has dropped considerably for both, putting its mortality rate on a par with the other countries."
Overall Mortality rates have fallen over a quarter century.
Mortality rate in women has fallen more than male mortality rate in majority of countries (all except the United States).
"Mortality rate tends to decrease from 1990 to 2015 for Rwanda followed by India, Bangladesh, USA and China with the lowest mortality rate."
The decrease in adult mortality rate is the most notable in Rwanda.
The decrease in adult morality is higher for females in every country except the United States.
In all data sets it is clear adult mortality decreased in general between 1990 and 2015.
The mortality rates decreases and the percentages are lower in countries such as USA and China where they have advanced healthcare.
Bangladesh and India percentages are roughly the same even though their populations are vastly different.
Bangladesh and India male percentages are exactly the same even though India has far more people in their country.
"We can see that from 1990 to 2015 almost in every country the number of deaths per 1000 people falls down, that could be due to the advanced healthcare."
The decrease increases with the number of years presented for every country.
Rwanda had the biggest decrease but still the highest rate.
"Generally, more males die than females."
The USA had the smallest decrease in mortality rate.
China has the lowest mortality rate of any country.
"A horizontal bar chart entitled “US change in median net worth by four-year college degree status” that plots the change in median net worth by demographic (White, Asian, Hispanic, Black) and whether Degreed or No Degree."
Asian people tends to have the most negative change with No Degree and also the greatest positive change with a Degree.
White people have the least change for both categories (No Degree and Degreed).
Hispanic people have the most negative change for the Degreed category.
"Asian people have the highest percent change of people who finished the degree with the +5.1%, but they have the large negative percent change for people who have No Degree, at -65.3%."
"Hispanic people have the largest negative change for people who have a Degree, at -71.9%, and a significant negative change for people with No Degree, -41.2%."
"Black people who have No Degree are at -37.3%, and a negative change -59.7% for people with a Degree."
"White people have a negative change of -16% for people who have a Degree, and a negative percent change of -32.9% for people who have No Degree."
The median net worth before and after the degree has some astonishing results.
"For a white person with no degree and after degree change in worth is 16% but still, the net worth is negative."
"For Hispanic people, the degreed net worth is even less as compared to the non-degree, where a further 30% reduction in net worth is observed."
A similar trend is observed for black people as well: there was a 22% reduction in median net worth.
"But only for Asian people a 5% of positive change was observed for people with a degree, whereas a non-degree Asian person's net worth was -65%."
"Amongst all the population demographics, only Asian Degreed has a positive median net worth change."
Asian No Degree has the 2nd highest negative value.
"Both No Degree and Degreed for Hispanic people has some of the largest negative values, with Hispanic Degreed being the largest negative value."
Both No Degree and Degreed for White people has the smallest negative values.
Median net worth for white people with no degree decreased by -32%.
Median net worth for Asian people with no degree decreased by -65.3%.
"Overall, there is a decrease in median net worth for all people (with a Degree or with No Degree), except for Asian people with a Degree, for whom there is an increase in median net worth of 5.1%"
Median net worth of white people seems to be less affected by lack of 4 year college degree status.
"Asian people with high college degree benefit more than anyone in US in median net worth, and Asian people without college degree have the lowest median net worth value of all available."
"Black and Hispanic people without a 4 year college degree have much higher median net worth change than the same people with a degree, but still lower than white people without a degree."
The only demographic with positive change in net worth is Asian.
For Hispanic and Black population the net worth change is lower when degreed.
"White people are the ones with the lowest percentage of no degree, then Black people follow, then Hispanic people, and lastly Asian, who have an increase in median net worth with a percentage of 5.1 for people with degrees."
The only increase in median net worth is Asian people with a degree.
Hispanic people with degree had the highest negative change.
White people with no degree had the smallest change from all the groups.
Every group with no degree has a negative median net worth change.
Asian people have the biggest difference in change in median net worth depending on having a degree or not.
White people have the smallest difference in change in median net worth depending on having a degree or not.
White people have the highest change in median net worth without a degree.
Asian people have the lowest change in median net worth without a degree.
Asian people have the highest change in median net worth with a degree.
Hispanic people have the lowest change in median net worth with a degree.
White and Asian people with a degree have a more positive change in median net worth.
Black and Hispanic people with a degree have a more negative change in median net worth.
An illustrated bar chart entitled “The Influx of Opioid Pills and the Surge in Overdoses in West Virginia” that plots the number of pills per person and the number of overdoses by Year.
The Number of pills per person is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 90.
The number of opioid overdoses is represented by each red pill equaling 10 opioid overdoses.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2011.
The increase of opioid drugs doesn't seem to have a consistent relationship to the number of overdoses.
There are probably other socio-economic factors that need to be considered when looking into the reasoning behind this study.
On average there has been a steady increase in both the number of opioid pills per person and the number of opioid overdoses.
"2009 is the exception, where the overdoses are lower even as the number of opioid pills per person continued to increase."
"The greatest number of opioid overdoses occurred in 2011, which also had the greatest number of pills per person."
"While there is a steadily increasing trend in opioid overdoses, there was a dip in 2009, which say fewer overdoses despite the number of opioid pills per person increasing."
The maximum number of opioid pills per person appears in 2011 and the lowest in 2004.
"There is a steady increase in the amount of Opioid pills being taken in West Virginia, and there is a steady increase in the amount of overdoses in West Virginia."
"In 2009, there was a slight decrease in overdoses within West Virginia compared to 2010."
"In 2010, there was a large increase in overdoses in West Virginia - this could be due to changes in drug creation."
"By 2011, a large percentage of people taking Opioid pills are overdosing compared to those who are not."
The number of opioid overdoses dipped in 2009 on what seems to be a general overall trend each year of an increase of opioid overdoses per year.
"For example, there were 200 opioid overdoses in 2006-2007, 300 in 2008, outlier drop to 150 in 2009, back up to 400 in 2010, and 500 in 2011."
"The number of pills per person prescribed has a flatter but upward/increasing trend, from ~42 pills per person in 2006 to ~48 in 2007, ~56 in 2008, ~58 in 2009 and 2010, and ~61 in 2011."
"The number of overdoses seems to be in the same upward direction but starker than the prescribing rate, with the 2009 dip in overdoses as an outlier."
The pills per person trend is overall increasing.
"The overdose trend is also generally increasing, but more volatile."
The overdoses were at their lowest in 2009.
The overdoses were at their highest in 2011.
The number of overdoses/pills ratio was the lowest in 2009.
The number of overdoses/pills ratio was the highest in 2011.
There is an increasing pattern in the number of pills per person.
Overall we can say that there is an increasing pattern in the number of overdoses per year (the only exception is the year 2009).
"Overall it seem that there is a positive correlation between the number of opioid pills per person and the number of overdoses per year (again, the only exception is the year 2009)."
The lowest number of overdoses was registered in 2009.
The highest number of overdoses was registered in 2011.
Between 2009 and 2010 was a big jump of overdoses.
2006 was the year with the lowest number of pills per person.
2009 and 2011 were the years with the highest number of pills per person.
"Even though 2009 was a year with one of highest number of pills per person, the number of opioid overdoses was the lowest."
2011 was the year with the highest number of opioid overdoses.
"After 2007, the number of pills per person every year seems stable."
"Except for 2009, the number of opioid overdoses grows higher every year."
The number of opioid overdoses seems correlated with the number of pills per person (with the exception of 2009).
"The number of opioid overdoses could be related to the fact that each year, people are more stressed due to other societal factors (unemployment, for example)."
A line plot that plots the difference from the base precision (%) by iteration.
The difference from base precision (%) is plotted on the vertical y-axis from -30 to 0.
The iteration is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0 to 10.
More iterations implies a more negative percent difference from base precision.
"There is a small increase bump after 6 iterations, but it continues to descend afterwards."
The difference from the base precision decrease with a higher number of iterations.
"After 4 iterations, the decrease is begins to taper off."
"As the number of iterations increases, the difference in base precision decreases."
"After 4 iterations, the difference from base precision begins to flatten."
"From 0 to 3 iterations, the difference from base precision rapidly decreases."
"There is a little raise during the 6th iteration, only to continue decreasing when we reach the 8th iteration."
The pattern that I obverse is always declining after a strong start.
"It never returns to 0, aside of the little raise during the 6th iteration, the trend seems to be decreasing at a stable rate."
The percent difference from base precision is steadily decreasing as the iteration increases.
The iteration on the X-axis shows the largest decrease in difference from base precision around 2 to 4 iterations.
"The greater the number of iterations, the greater percent difference from base precision."
There is a general downwards trend between base precision and iteration.
There is a slight peak (decrease) in the difference from base precision at the 6th iteration.
From the chart above it shows that difference base precision with respect to iteration rises most from 2 iteration and continue to increase till it gets to 10 iterations.
As we increase the number of iterations the difference from base precision becomes more negative.
At 2 iterations the difference from the base precision plummets to a very negative value.
In the range between 4 and 10 iterations the difference from the base precision becomes smaller at a slower pace.
"The higher the iteration, the higher the difference from base precision."
As the iteration increases the difference from base precision decreases.
A line plot entitled “Russia unemployment” that shows the unemployment rate by year.
The unemployment rate is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 4 to 10%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2015.
Unemployment is generally decreasing in Russia besides peaking once in 2009.
Unemployment follows a zig-zag recurring pattern in the graph.
Unemployment reached an all-time low around August 2014.
Maximum unemployment (about 9%) was recorded in early 2009.
"Unemployment in Russia spiked at the beginning of 2009, correlating with the recession that started at the end of 2007."
Generally unemployment in Russia is heading downward.
Unemployment in Russia spikes at the beginning of each year.
From '10 it is going down at the beginning of the year and rising at the end of the year.
"Unemployment in Russia rose up in 2009 and stayed on high level to 2011, when it went down to the previous percentage."
"From 2012 to 2015, unemployment in Russia is jumping from 5% to 6%."
"In 2009 and 2010, the unemployment rate in Russia is the highest."
"In mid-2014, the unemployment rate in Russia is the lowest."
The graph for unemployment in Russia between 2006 and 2015 shows a continuous zigzag pattern.
The zig-zag pattern tends to follow similar annual changes.
"It appears to decrease during the first half of the year, and increase during the second half."
The unemployment rate showed a considerable increase during the financial crisis in late 2008-2010.
"Since 2010, the unemployment rate gradually decreased until 2015."
The variation within unemployment tends to be less volatile after than financial crisis than before.
As it gets closer to the end of the year the unemployment increases.
After the increase there is a fast decrease in the next year.
"Overall, unemployment has decreased over the years."
The unemployment rate never exceeded 9.5.
Over time the unemployment rate has been decreasing.
The Russia unemployment chart shows a zig zag pattern.
It increases at some points and decreases at some points.
"Overall, unemployment is decreasing."
The highest unemployment rate in Russia was in 2009 and 2010 (above 9%).
The lowest unemployment rate was in 2014 (below 5%).
Since 2010 unemployment rate is going down.
In 2008 unemployment rate went up from 5 to 9%.
Each year unemployment rate goes down and up.
"As time goes by, there is a general decreasing trend of unemployment rate."
There is a spike in 2009 of 9%.
The unemployment rate fluctuates constantly.
Overall the rate decreased from 7.5 to 5.5 percent from 2006 to 2015.
A line plot entitled “Walmart reports sixth straight quarterly gain in US sales” that plots the US sales by Year.
The US sales are plotted on the vertical y-axis from 70 to $90 billion.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2010 to 2016.
"Over the years 2010-2011, the sales go down slightly."
"2011 onwards however the sales slowly rise steadily until 2014-2015 where it has a steeper increase, then returning to it's gradual increase and still increases to 82% in 2016"
2016 had the highest quarterly gain by Walmart in US.
2011 Walmart had the lowest quarterly gain compared to their recent years.
The rise in quarterly gain by Walmart shows Walmart's future is safe.
Small local shops are becoming more rare.
As Walmart provides cheaper products people are forced more to shop there due to economic situations.
These years are all after the 2008 recession which caused a lot of economic uncertainty.
Walmart's sales seem to be going up almost every year.
Walmart's highest year for sales was 2016.
Walmart's lowest year for sales was 2011.
The earliest years (2010-2011) might be lower because of the 2008 economic crisis.
There is a clear stable upwards trend for sales.
The growth in sales between 2011 and 2014 is linear.
"Overall, there is a general upwards trend."
The only year where there is a decrease is between 2010 and 2011.
The largest value on the graph is 82 during the year 2016.
The lowest value on the graph is about 71 during the year 2011.
"Between the years 2011 and 2014, the amount of increase is the same."
The largest increase occurs in between the years 2014 and 2015.
2016 has been the year with highest number of sales for Walmart.
"Before 2016, 2015 seems to has had the biggest tendency or growth in gains."
"2011 is the year with least gains, and even so shows a decrease in the earnings."
"While there was a slight decline in sales from 2010 to 2011, the US sales for Walmart have been increasing since 2011."
The US sales increased from 2011 to 2014 on a steady pace.
The span from 2014 to 2015 shows the steepest increase in US sales.
The US sales were increasing for five straight years.
"Other than in 2010-2011, the sales keep rising every year."
"Probably, there was economic crisis peaking in 2011, which resulted in a slight lack of sales."
There is a similar steady rise of sales between 2011-2014 and 2015-2016.
"In 2014-2015 there has been a greater rise in sales, probably due to commercial or economical rise."
Walmart made around 350 billion $ in the course of 6 years in US.
Walmart gained less earnings in 2011.
Walmart keeps making more money each year.
Walmart was at $82 billion in 2016.
"If this trend has continued, today Walmart could be past past $90 billion."
Since 2011 the Walmart gains have been steadily increasing each year.
There was a dip in sales from 2010 and 2011.
The biggest annual increase was from 2014 to 2015.
Though the rate of sales briefly increased between 2014 and 2015 the rate of increase resumed to the previous rates after 2015.
A line plot entitled “Federal Reserve federal funds funds [sic] interest rate target” that plots the interest rate target by Year.
The interest rate target is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 6%.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2005 to 2015.
"The interest target rate slowly goes up over the year of 2005-2007, stays on a steady at 5% until 2008 and decreases sharply until a small point about 1/3 through 2008, stays steady for a little bit at 2% until it falls again in 2009, and is completely flat at nearly 0% from 2009 onwards."
The interest rate rose to almost 6 percent by 2007 and remained stable throughout 2008.
"However, following 2008 interest dropped significantly in 2009 to just above 0 percent."
This rate continued to be consistent until 2015.
The rate of interest may have dropped following the recession in 2008/09.
Ever since the 2008 recession interest rate targets have been fixed at less than 1%.
There was a gradual rise reflecting 'stairs' in the interest rate target between 2005 and 2006.
The interest target fell by more than 4% between 2008 and 2009.
Interest rates plateaued during the 2008 economic recession.
"Since the 2008 recession, interest rates have lowered."
"Interest rates increased constantly from 2005 to 2007 until the recession hit in 2008, at which point it is flat at nearly 0%."
"The interest rate rapidly increased form 2005 to 2005 going from a 2% to a 6%, reaching a plateau at 6% between 2006 and end of 2007 and rapidly decreasing between 2008 and 2009, reaching almost 0% value."
"From 2009 to nowadays the interest rate never increased again, remaining at the same rate since 2009."
The interest rate target keeps rising up until the middle of 2006.
There's a period of time after a quick rise where the interest rate target doesn't change for a year.
After 2009 the interest rate target doesn't change at all.
This probably means that after 2009 they used low interest rates to get people to invest more.
Before the financial crisis the federal funds interest rate was constantly increasing.
Because of the financial crisis the  interest rate plummeted to almost 0%.
This is because the Federal Reserve had to provide liquidity to the market.
From 2009 to 2015 the interest rate did not change.
There has been a (mostly) steady rise every month between years 2005-2006.
"In years 2006-2008, the rates remained steady, slightly above 5%."
"From 2008-2009, there has been an abrupt fall in rates every month, but in a period around July-August, the rates remained the same exactly at 2%."
"From 2009 since 2015, the rates either remained completely steady just above 0%."
From 2005 to 2007 the interest of federal funds had increased from ~2 to ~5.
From 2007 to 2008 it stayed the same (a little bit more than 5 %).
"At the end of the year 2007, the interest had decreased drastically in only one year from 5 % to 0."
Since 2009 there has been no interest of federal funds.
We can observe a gradual increase from 2005 to mid 2006 in the interest rate.
From mid 2006 to early 2008 there has been a halt and it seems that it's kept at a single rate of 5% for that duration of time.
After that it heavily drops down suddenly until it reaches the lowest it has been since 2005 in the beginning of 2009.
"We see neither increase or decrease after 2009, the rate sits at a steady 0."
"A line plot entitled “Taiwan exports in US dollars, annual change” that plots the annual change in exports by year."
The annual change in exports is plotted on the vertical y-axis from -60 to 80%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2015.
The Taiwan annual change in exports is lowest in 2009.
The Taiwan annual change in exports is highest in 2010.
There is a huge spike in annual change from 2009 to 2010.
"Between 2006 and mid 2008, Taiwan's exports in US dollars ranged between an estimated 22% and 5%."
"After that, there was a big drop in 2009 where the exports dropped to -38%."
Which makes sense because a lot happened to the economy due to the 2008 financial crisis.
"Then in 2010, the exports skyrocketed back up to a high of an estimated 78%."
"Between 2010 and 2012 it gradually dropped, fluctuating 5% up and down as time went by."
"Between 2012 and 2015, it ranged between a low of -18% and highs of 10-18%."
"Ultimately, in 2015, it began to drop again into the negative, reaching a -18."
"The graph shows that Taiwan experienced a period of stagnation from '06-'08, with a heavy decrease for a short period of time in exports in '07."
The percentage of exports drops dramatically in the summer of '08 to the summer of '09.
One can assume Taiwan experienced an economic recession during that time.
"However, Taiwan rebounds significantly and experiences the highest percentage of exports in '10."
The number of exports drops to '06 levels in the next two years after '10.
The graph trends downward and becomes rocky from '12 to '15.
Taiwan is experiencing a time of economic downturn post-2010 and is showing lower numbers than the '06 to '08 period.
We can see that between 2006 and 2009 the discrepancy between numbers weren't as high as 2010 and 2012 being the highest export in 2010 with over 80%.
"It is noticeable as the global crisis reaches it's peaking point in early 2009, the exports dropped drastically, but they rebound by 2010."
"The plot line seems to have frequent changes between months, with a zig-zagging pattern."
"It seems that the plot can be divided into three major parts: before mid 2008, between mid 2008 and 2010, and after 2010."
"Before 2008, the line is mostly above the 0%, mostly between 10 and 20%."
"It seems that a shock happened in 2008 that made the exports crash durably during one year, with exports going down by more than -20%."
"After that huge crash, the line spiked at a +80% exportation rate."
"After that huge spike in 2010, the exportation continued to zig-zag like before 2008 but not around +10 and +20% but closer to -10 and +10%."
"At the end of the graph, it is suggested that year 2015 wasn't good for exports, since it's going down without zigzag, suggesting there may be a more permanent dip."
We can suppose that the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008 caused that crash.
"After a huge crisis, there is usually a big bump that happen afterwards, which is clearly visible here in 2010, but this bump didn't last in the long-term."
We might also suppose that the irregular path in 2015 was caused by the new election in Taiwan of a pro-independence leader.
From 2006 to 2008 the trend was overall constant.
In 2008 there was a substantial drop in exports.
The 2008 drop in exports was probably due to the global financial crisis.
In 2009 there was a sudden recovery.
In 2009 the exports reached their peak.
"From 2010 to 2015 the exports register a more stable, but decreasing trend."
Prior to 2008 Taiwan exports in US dollars appeared to have consistent annual growth of around 20% per annum.
During the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 Taiwan's exports reduced significantly by around 40% in the year.
There was an immediate bounce back in 2010 with growth in the year of exports of nearly 80%.
"However, since 2010 Taiwan appears to have lost its competitive advantage to other nations and its exports have become less appealing."
This is shown by the gradual annual decline in exports every year since 2010.
"There was still positive growth in 2011, 2012 and 2013 but each year the growth rate declined and it became negative in 2015"
"Between 2006 and 2008, the annual change was more or less the same."
"From 2008 to 2009, it decreased significantly."
"From 2009 to 2010, it increased and had it's all time high."
"From 2010 to 2015, it slowly decreased at a regular pace until it became negative."
2009 was the year with the lowest amount of exports.
2010 was the year with the highest amount of exports.
"The amount of exports is in a constant fluctuation, nevertheless, it still maintains a relatively regular pattern, excluding years 2009 and 2010."
"After 2012, the exports are constantly dipping below 0."
In 2008 Taiwan exports in US dollars changed by -45%.
In 2009 was the lowest Taiwan exports in US dollars.
In 2009 Taiwan exports in US dollars increased by 76%.
From 2012 to 2014 Taiwan exports in US dollars is stable.
Since 2015 Taiwan exports in US dollars is dropping.
From 2008 to 2008 Taiwan exports in US dollars were increasing.
A multi-line plot entitled “Employment over time” that plots Male and Female employment by Year.
Female Employment is plotted on the left vertical axis from 40 to 60.
Male Employment is plotted on the right vertical axis from 50 to 100.
Female Employment is plotted in blue and Male Employment is plotted in pink.
This chart presents Female and Male employment using two different y-axis scales.
"This makes it appear as though Female employment is greater than Male employment, but the opposite is true."
Male employment exceeds Female employment from year 0 to 28.
Female employment is higher over time over as compared with Male employment.
Employment was lowest for both genders in the year of 2020.
Employment was highest for both genders in the year of 2010.
Both genders follow the same pattern for employment over time.
"The graph shows the change between male and female are very similar over time, but the percentages show males have a higher percentage throughout the time period."
Both genders experience the same increase and decrease in percent during the 20 year period.
"From the graph, one can observe that both genders are equal in the change of percent of employment but unequal in the amount of employment percentage."
The graph gives a confusing look on Female vs Male employment.
The graph makes it seem that Female employment is more than Male employment when the opposite is true.
Female employment peaks at around 56.5 while male employment peaks at around 70.
Male employment reaches its peak in 10 year with a 70% value.
Female employment reached his peak in 10 year with a 56% value.
Both employment rates started to decrease after that year.
Male employment reached lowest value of about 60% in 20 year.
Female employment reached lower value of 52% in 21 year.
Both employment rates seem to follow same trend with different percentiles each.
The chart makes it difficult to compare the rates.
Male employment had a record high in year 10 at 70%.
Male employment had an all-time low in year 20 at approximately 61%.
Female employment had a record high in year 10 at approximately 56%.
Female employment had an all-time low in year 21 at 52%.
Even the female highest rate point is barely near the male lowest point with a 5% difference in favor of male employment rate.
There's a serious contrast between the male employment rate and the female's.
The chart seems to be purposefully confusing and deceiving in order to look like female employment rates are higher than male's.
The chart does suggest that both rates have suffered parallel ups and downs.
The chart shows there has been little to no change in the difference between male and female employment rates.
Male and female employment follow roughly the same increases and decreases over the years.
"Between year 2 and year 10, female employment increased at a slightly higher level than male employment."
There is a greater gap between female and male employment at year 20 than there was at year 0.
"The graph can be misleading as the female employment line is above the male employment line which implies higher levels of employment, but the two different vertical axes means that this is not true."
Therefore this graph is confusing as a visual aid.
"This graph is unnecessarily confusing; both because there are two measurements on the y-axis with different scales per mm, and because the colors usually associated with Males and Females are reversed."
"It might seem at first that more females have been generally employed than males, but in fact, males count in numbers generally above 65, while the upper limit for females is 60."
Both sexes have similar ups and downs.
"While it may seem that females have a generally more abrupt statistics, their y-axis is in much smaller scale than males', which mean the changes in employment over years are as small."
The employment for both men and women are not stable.
Female employment rises at an increasing rate from 0 to 10 and it starts decreasing from 10 to 14.
It starts increasing again at the point of 14 to 18.
"In year 20, Male employment was the lowest with 61, and Female employment was the same at year 21 with 52."
"The biggest employment over time was the biggest in year 10, males 70 and females 56."
In year 18 male as well as females employment decreased.
A line plot entitled “Future price for a pound of oranges” that plots price by year.
Price is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to $2.50.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2000 to 2015.
Future price of oranges is highest in 2007 and 2012.
Future price of oranges is lowest in 2004.
There is a huge spike in price of oranges from 2004 to 2007.
The price of a pound of oranges has experienced a rollercoaster of increases and decreases over a 15 year period.
The price hit its highest at around $2.00 in '07 and '12.
One can observe this change as a result of a decrease in the supply of oranges or an increase in demand for oranges.
The price decreased dramatically after '07 and '12.
This may be due to an increase in the production of oranges to make up for demand but the demand has decreased.
The price of oranges appear to be in a zigzag pattern.
The most expansion years were 2007 and 2012.
I would speculate there were extreme weather conditions that would have caused costs to increase during that time.
The price of a pound of oranges peaked twice in 2007 and in 2012.
"After peaking, the price goes down by almost 50% in the span of 2-3 years."
The maximum price barely exceeds $2.
The minimum price is around $0.50.
The price seems to be stabilizing over the long term.
"After every spike in the futures price for oranges, it tends to go down again."
"For example, at '04, it started to going up, it does a spike at '07, from 0.50 cents to 2 dollars, then it goes down and at 1 dollar it goes up again."
"Same for the second spike, starts at '09 at 0,60 cents, goes up, '11 has the spike at almost 1,90 dollars, and then it goes down until 0.90."
"The average futures price for oranges is going up every year, and seems like it will keep doing so."
We can see that 2007 was the year with the most elevated futures price for a pound of oranges.
"We can see that there is pattern of cyclicality between the years, with huge differences between the highest and the lowest prices."
The futures price of oranges has remained consistent between $1 and $2 between 2000 and 2015.
This is despite the futures price of other commodities growing significantly in the same time period.
There was a low of approximately $0.75 in 2004.
There was a high of approximately $2 in 2004 and again in 2012.
Interestingly the futures price of oranges appears to follow the same trend of the global economy.
There was a fall in the price of oranges during the financial crisis of 2008/2009 before recovering to pre crash levels almost immediately in 2010.
From 2005-2007 and 2010-2012 were years with little orange production because the price increased a lot.
The years 2004 and 2009 were years with a lot of production the maximum price reached $2.
A pound of oranges was priciest towards the end of the year 2007 and the beginning of the year 2012.
"At these two points, the pound of oranges costs a little over 2 dollars."
"The cheapest price according to the chart was the spring to summer of 2004, where a pound of oranges only cost about 0.50 cents."
There appears to be no seasonal trend in the price of oranges.
"With the exception of two spikes from 2005-2007 and 2009-2011, the price appears fairly stable just around 1-1.50 dollars per pound."
A pound of oranges was most expensive in 2012.
A pound of oranges was cheapest in 2004.
Its been constantly changing since 15 years.
Prices in 2012 are similar to those in 2015.
A pound of oranges is more expensive in 2015 than it was in 2000.
The price of pound of oranges often fluctuates.
The lowest price for a pound of oranges took place in mid 2004.
The lowest price for a pound of oranges was $0.50.
The highest price for a pound of oranges was 2007 and 2012.
The highest price for a pound of oranges was $2.00.
"After 2005, the price for a pound of oranges follows a zigzag pattern."
"From 2000 to 2006, the price for a pound of oranges was the most stable."
The price for a pound of oranges might depend on the economic situation of the country and the weather.
The average price for a pound of oranges from 2000 to 2015 was around $1.25.
A line plot entitled “San Francisco homes valued at $1 million or more” that plots the percentage of San Francisco homes by year.
The percentage of San Francisco homes is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 20 to 70%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2011 to 2015.
Throughout the years the housing value has significantly risen and more homes are valued at 1 million USD or more.
There has been a growth in percentage of expensive housing from 25% to 65%.
There was a slight drop in the percentage between 2011 and 2012.
There was a slight drop in the percentage in the beginning of 2014.
Only 35% of housing is valued less than 1 million USD.
The number of home estimated at 1 million or more is stagnant at 25% until 2012 when it begins to rise rapidly each year until 2015 when 63% of houses are estimated at 1 million.
This positive correlation implies that average property value has increased between 2011 and 2015.
The percentage of San Francisco homes valued at $1 million or more has increased exponentially from 2011 to 2015.
The prices of housing in San Francisco has known a drastic increase from 2011 until 2015.
The percentage of expensive homes has declined in 2012 but then drastically peaked from 2013 until 2015.
A small recession of a couple of months can be observed early 2014 but the percentage increased by another 10% until the end of the year.
The highest increase can be seen in 2015 with an increase of around 15% of home valued at 1 Million dollars.
The house value of San Francisco has gradually increased year by year in a quasi-linear manner.
A minimum of 20% of houses costs more than 1 million in the year 2012 and after 4 years the house costs of more than 70% in the year 2016.
"We can see that starting from 2012, the prices are sky-rocketing and still going up."
"It starts as a linear increase but then after 2015, it seems like an exponential increase."
"From this plot, we can conclude that homes at San Francisco are becoming very pricy and the area is likely very elite, since not much people can afford that price."
There is a general upwards trend from 2011 to 2015.
There was a slight downward trend towards the end of 2012.
The rate of increase in home values was more significant between 2013 and 2015 than 2011 and 2012.
Before the year '11 homes started decreasing their value.
"In those years, homes valued at over $1 million were a little above 20%."
"From '12 on, they started increasing again and they haven't stopped."
"By the year '15, around 50% of San Francisco's homes were valued at $1 million or more."
San Francisco had a decrease in value of the houses at the beginning from around 2010 until 2012.
"From 2012 onwards there is an increase in value again reaching almost 70%, at 2013, 2014, and 2015 there is a small bump in the direction of the curve."
Before 2011 there were more homes valued at $1 million or more than it was in the next 2 years (2011-2012).
In early 2011 and early 2012 the percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more was at its lowest.
Since 2012 the percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more has began to increase gradually.
Since 2015 the growth in the percentage of homes has been much greater relative to previous years.
The percentage of homes valued more than 1 million started growing in mid-2012.
It increased from 25% to around 65%.
The fastest growth was observed in 2015.
The percentage of homes valued more than 1 million is almost exponentially growing since 2012.
The percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more started to increase at around 2012.
"In 2012 the percentage was around 25%, and in 2015 around 63%."
The trend is that the percentage of homes valued at $1 million is increasing drastically over years.
Homes in San Francisco have become more expensive due to gentrification.
"Additionally, during the 2010s websites like Airbnb made San Francisco homes become more expensive. And tech companies have gentrified SF neighborhoods, which have become more costly."
"Starting in 2012, there is a sharp increase in the percentage of homes that are valued at more than $1 million."
There is a very slight drop in the percentage in the beginning of 2014.
"By the end of 2015, more than 60% of the homes in San Francisco are valued at more than $1 million."
The percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more seems to be growing almost exponentially.
The percentage was possibly lower due to the 2008 economic crisis.
The percentage started to spike between 2012 and 2013.
The percentage peaked in 2015.
"In the year '12, only a 20% of San Francisco's homes were valued at $1 million or more."
This rate started increasing ever since that year.
"By the year '15, 50% of the homes were valued at that quantity."
After only 4 years there are more than double the amount of homes valued at $1 million.
From 2011 to 2015 the slope of the curve has become steeper.
This means that either people in San Francisco are earning more or this city in particular has become a place where wealthier families want to live.
The general trend over the years from 2011-2015 is an upwards trend.
a slight downward trend between 2011 and early 2012.
There are no huge troughs in the upward trend except a small plateau in the beginning of 2014.
The percentage of homes valued over $1 million increased drastically from year 13 to 15 which amounts from 30 to 65% respectively.
A line plot entitled “San Francisco homes valued at $1 million or more” that plots the percentage of San Francisco homes by year.
Percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 20 to 70%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2011 to 2015.
At around the start of each decade there is a decrease in unemployment which increases at the middle of each decade.
The lowest unemployment rate is at the start of the 00s.
The 00s had the lowest unemployment rates compared to other decades.
The 80s and the 10s had the highest unemployment rates compared to other decades.
The rate of unemployment regularly zigzags up and down.
There seems to be more rates of employment than unemployment--there tend to be very large spikes in unemployment with long periods of employment.
There hasn't been as bad unemployment since 1982.
"The pattern is repetitive, first a high jump, then rough fall."
The 'jumps' seem to last about 2 to 4 years.
High jumps seem to happen after rough falls.
The dips of unemployment seem to mostly worsen every decade or so.
These dips seem to have lessened since the year 2000.
The declines are less steep than the inclines (true every time ((per graph))).
"What ever the input was in 2008, it seemed to make a massive difference (5% to overall unemployment in the green)."
The year 1983 had the highest unemployment rate on the graph.
The year 2000 had the lowest unemployment rate on the graph.
"Unemployment appears cyclical, increasing sharply each recession and then dropping back down."
"On the graph, longest period with unemployment below 5% is 5 years."
The lowest employment rate of every decade occurs about 8 years in.
The highest employment rate of every decade occurs about 1-4 years in.
After the employment rate reaches its peak for the decade it immediately drops.
"The highest US unemployment rate was registered in 1983, with a percentage of almost 11%."
"Before 1983, the highest US unemployment rate registered was 9% in the 1970s."
"After 1983, the US unemployment rate started lowering until it reached a percentage of around 5% in 1990."
"Soon after 1990, the US unemployment rate started going up again until it reached a percentage of just under 8%."
"The lowest US unemployment rate plotted was registered in 2000, with a percentage of less than 4%."
"Between 2008 and 2010, the US unemployment rate skyrocketed, jumping from around 4,5% to a maximum of 10% in said period of time."
"Between 2011 and 2012, the US unemployment rate started lowering until it reached a percentage of 5% in 2014."
"Overall, the line is erratic and we can see how much the US unemployment rate varies from 1976 and 2014."
We can see that unemployment rate increases drastically every 10 years or so and then slowly decreases.
The highest unemployment rate in US was in '83 and the lowest in '00.
"From 1976 to 2014, the biggest peaks in the US unemployment rate, when compared to its previous years, occurred in: 1976 (9%), 1983 (11%), 1992 (8%), 2004 (6.5% ) and in 2010 (10%)."
"We can also refer to the lowest unemployment rate that occurred between these intervals: 1979 (5.5%), 1989 (5%), 2000 (4%) and 2007 (4.5%)."
"Tracing these points, we can establish an almost linear relationship between each interval, obtaining a zigzag graph."
"It is worth noting that in all cases, these peaks in the US unemployment rate increase on average in the space of 2 to 3 years, reaching lower values later passing between 4 to 8 years."
The unemployment rate fell sharply between '85 and '09.
The lowest unemployment was in the year '00.
The highest unemployment was in '83.
Unemployment in America is currently falling.
A multi-line chart entitled “Accuracy v/s Data Size” that plots the Percent Accuracy by the Number of Words in the Training Data.
The Percent Accuracy is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 75 to 100.
"The Number of Words in the Training Data is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 10,000 to 60,000."
"There are three lines plotted: WF (white square), Weak-MF (black square), and Rich-MF (white circle)."
"The more words in the training data, the higher the accuracy."
"The black square (Weak-MF) consistently has the highest accuracy, regardless of the data size."
"The white square (WF) consistently has the lowest accuracy, regardless of the data size."
Weak-MF has the highest accuracy with over 95%.
WF has the lowest accuracy with about 80%.
Rich-MF is in the middle with an accuracy of about 90%.
"For all variables (WF, Weak-MF, and Rich-MF) the accuracy grows rapidly early on, but then remains about the same past the 20,000 words in the Training Data."
Weak-MF has the highest at about 95%.
WF has the lowest accuracy at about 80%.
The average accuracy is roughly 85%.
The percentage accuracy is least for WF where an average accuracy of 80-85% between the number of words in training data range 1-60000.
The maximum WF accuracy of 85% was observed at 60000 words.
The percentage accuracy is maximum for Weak-MF where an average accuracy of 85-95% between the number of words in training data range 1-60000.
The maximum Weak-MF accuracy of 95% was observed at 60000 words.
The percentage accuracy is in the middle for Rich-WF with an average accuracy of 82-90% between the number of words in training data range 1-60000.
The maximum Rich-WF accuracy of 90% was observed at 60000 words.
All variables show a logarithmic pattern between the number of words in training data and accuracy implying that the marginal increased rate of accuracy per increased number of words in the training data decreases.
"For all variables, the accuracy seems to increase as the data size increases, however, the marginal increase diminishes as data size increases."
Weak-MF shows constantly higher accuracy rates than both Rich-MF and WF.
Rich-MF shows constantly higher accuracy than WF.
"The marginal increase rate for WF is lower than for the other two variables - this is particularly present for the first 15,000 words."
"The marginal increase accuracy rate appears to be approximately similar for the three variables when the data size is bigger than 10,000 words in training data."
"The more the words, the better the accuracy."
Weak-MF has the highest accuracy overall.
WF has the lowest accuracy overall.
"Over 10000 words, the accuracy slightly increases."
"Under 10000 words, the accuracy decreases considerably."
Weak MF has the highest accuracy.
"For all the lines, increasing the number of words in the training set has positive effects at the beginning."
Once reached a threshold (about 20000 words) adding new words doesn't increase the accuracy remarkably.
WF has the lowest accuracy while Weak-MF and Rich-MF have similar values.
The accuracy trend for WF and Rich-MF are very close to each other.
"As the number of words in the Training Data increases, so does the percent accuracy, for all variables (WF, Weak-MF, and Rich-MF)."
The increase in accuracy appears to follow a logarithmic trend for all variables.
"Weak-MF achieves the highest accuracy, followed by Rich-MF, followed by WF."
A line plot entitled “Relative Recall (Pattern-based vs Co-occurrence-based)” that plots the Relative Recall by Datasets.
The Relative Recall is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0.00 to 7.00.
"The Datasets are plotted on the horizontal x-axis for the following sizes: 1.5MB, 15MB, 150MB, 1.5GB, 8GB, and 15GB (projected)."
"The relative recall is highest for the 1.5MB dataset at around 6.00, and is significantly for the 15MB and 150MB datasets."
"The relative recall increases as the dataset capacity increases (from 1.5GB to 15GB datasets), moving from 2.00 to 4.00."
"The graph shows the datasets are at its most efficient at very low capacity datasets, and feasible at higher capacity datasets greater than 1.5GB."
"As the dataset size increases, the relative recall first drops drastically, but then gradually increases."
The lowest relative recall is about 1.00 for the 150MB dataset.
Once relative recall is above 1GB it gradually increases.
Relative recall decreases rapidly from 6.5 to 1 when MB increase to 15MB and again drops further when MB increases to 150MB.
However between 1.5GB and 6GB the relative recall increases and somewhat recovers to 3.1 and is (projected) to continue rising in relation to the number of GB.
This suggests that after 15MB there is a positive relationship between relative recall and dataset size.
"As datasets increase, relative recall increases as well, except for datasets of capacity less than 150MB."
For small datasets (1.15M to 150MB) the relative recall drops rapidly.
"However, as the dataset size continues to increase (1.15GB to 15GB) the relative recall also gradually increases with it."
"The increase in relative recall is linear with increase of data sets, between 15MB and 15GB, with 150MB having an abnormally lower value."
"Opposed to this tendency, the highest relative recall value is registered at 1.5MB, 1.5 times higher than 15GB Projected value."
The relative recall is initially highest for the 1.5MB dataset.
"Between 15MB and 150MB, the relative recall drops rapidly."
"From 1.5GB to 15GB, the relative recall goes up again, following a linear trend."
The relative recall decreases to its lowest point at 15MB and 150MB.
Then it is gradually increasing again from 1.5GB to 15GB.
The highest relative recall rate is for 1.5MB at just over 6.0.
This trend drops to just over 1.0 for 15MB.
It drops further to under 1.00 for 150MB.
"After this it starts rising again to 2.00 for 1.5GB, just over 3.00 for 6GB and just under 4.00 for 15GB."
The drop is steep between 1.5MB and 150MB and then rises at a more gradual rate between 150MB and 15GB.
The relative recall pattern decreases drastically at 1.5 to 15MB.
It continued to decrease till 150MB.
It started increasing little by little till it gets to 15GB.
A multi-line chart entitled “Title” that plots the stock price of big tech corporations by year.
"The corporations include AAPL (Apple), AMZN (Amazon), GOOG (Google), IBM (IBM), and MSFT (Microsoft)."
The years are plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2000 to 2010 with an increment of 2 years.
The prices are plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 800 with an increment of 200.
All stock prices apart from Google increase steadily.
As Google starts to become more popular and buy out other companies its stock price increases.
"The continuous expansion of the internet has also changed how people use Google, and how necessary Google has become."
"Once GOOG took off, it quickly became the most valuable tech company."
From 2010 AAPL the second most valuable after a steady growth period.
"In the last quarter of 2008, all companies experienced a slump probably due to the economic crisis of the time."
GOOG took the biggest hit with MSFT taking the smallest.
"At the beginning of 2008, every of this stock price went down, likely due to the financial crisis."
"Then they have risen again and dropped again, more so than previously."
The corporation named GOOG rose high up with stock prices as it started running in half of 2014.
The corporation named GOOG has the most expensive stock price for a Big Tech corporation in the overview.
"Beneath GOOG, there is corporation named AAPL, scoring second place after it rose up after 2007."
"In mid-2004, the GOOG stock price suddenly started to increase drastically."
"At the end of 2008, GOOG experienced a major dip in its stock price, as did the other companies (but to a lesser extent)."
"From 2000 to 2004 the GOOG stock price did not exist at all, due to the fact that the company didn't yet exist."
"From the end of 2000 to 2004, the AAPL stock price was also very low, possibly because this was prior to the release of the iPhone."
Google took off from 2004 to 2008 and then took a big hit in 2008.
"All the other stock prices stay mostly steady for ten years, gradually rising, but nowhere close to as much as Google."
"GOOG was born after all the others (2004) and since it's birth it's been the most valuable around even with it's highs and lows, it's highest price was 710 in the middle of 2007, it's lower was 200 in the middle of 2004."
"IBM has almost had the same value over the years, with a slight depression from 2002 to 2007 but still keeping it's value around 100."
"AAPL started real low and started growing in 2004, after that it kept a pattern of growth and drop, it's highest was 215 in 2010, it's lowest is around 10 in 2003."
"AMZN started a bit bigger but went low over the course of 2000, it started growing in 2003 and has since followed a high low pattern like AAPL, lowest value is around 0 in the middle of 2001, highest 120 at the end of 2019."
MSFT has had no particular growth or drop and kept its value at around 10 over the course of the years.
Google stock prices surged somewhere around 2005 - possibly related to the success of YouTube.
It was also around that time when the Google search engine became really dominant.
"All companies' stock prices fell down somewhere in 2007-2008 (due to the financial crisis), but bounced back afterwards."
"Google has the highest stock price, while Microsoft's stock price seems like the most stable one."
"Apple stock prices started to rise after 2009, probably related to the iPhone's (and smartphones in general) growth in popularity."
"In mid-2004, GOOG shares surged up, permanently exceeding the prices of the other four companies."
GOOG has experienced both significant drops (due to the 2008 crash) and significant gains.
"However, the remaining companies are more or less stable."
They do not have such large price fluctuations as GOOG.
"IBM, AMZN and MSFT all remain in similar sale heights throughout the chart's time span."
"Since 2004, GOOG has the highest stock prices of all the companies."
"IBM, AMZN and MSFT remain closer to the bottom of the chart in every year."
GOOG has the highest price over the years.
MSFT has the lowest price over the years.
GOOG quickly became the richest one of the Big Tech corporations.
"GOOG had experienced some kind of a crisis in 2009, because their prices drop rapidly, but then rebound."
Google has the greatest price over time and Microsoft has the lowest price over time.
Google has also had the most dramatic increases over time.
Tech company prices are steadily increasing overtime and despite set backs are likely to do so.
Stock prices for tech companies vary drastically over time but generally increase in the long run.
The more stable stock is in companies that manufacture computers while those that are closer to new technology increase and decrease and are less stable.
The corporation with the greatest price over time is GOOG.
The corporation with the lowest price over time is MSFT.
All the companies experienced a dip in prices right before 2009.
"The financial crisis of 2008 had an effect on the stock prices of Big Tech companies, which is what caused a large dip right before 2009."
"Though after this crisis, they all seemed to rebound pretty quickly and continued to increase at 2010."
GOOG has the greatest price over time and MSFT has the lowest.
"On average the price of the big tech corporations has increased over time, especially for GOOG."
"The price of MSFT has decreased over time and the prices of AAPL, AMZN, and IBM  have not increased as much as GOOG."
GOOG has the greatest price over time.
MSFT has the lowest price over time.
Prices of particular Big Tech corporations seem to fluctuate but nevertheless increase overtime.
Years 2008-2009 are exceptions as we can see extreme drop in prices of all given Corporations.
The big drop in prices was caused by Financial crisis of 2007-2008.
"The crisis culminated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 and an international banking crisis."
"Since mid-2004, GOOG had a steep increase in its stock price, and has the highest stock price."
"MSFT has the lowest stock price since around mid 2004, and there has been little change in its stock price over the years."
"GOOG had a very steep increase in its stock price since mid-2004, before which it was close to zero according to the chart."
AMZN shows little but steady increase in its price over time.
MSFT has been maintaining a steady and low stock price.
"GOOG had a steep increase in its stock price since mid-2004 and reached its peak in late 2007, but had a sharp decline around year 2009, which may have been due to the global economic depression at the time."
"However, it returned to the original price range by year 2010."
A multi-line plot entitled “Unemployment rates in the Palestinian Territories” that plots unemployment rate by year.
The unemployment rate is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 50%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 1995 to 2014.
The Gaza Strip is plotted in purple.
The West Bank is plotted in blue.
The Gaza Strip already can be seen to have higher unemployment compared to West Bank.
The patterns both move quite similarly until around 2003.
"However, while West Bank's goes down to less than 20% over the years 2002-2014, the Gaza Strip's unemployment rates go up and down in zig zags, hitting a point at 40% in 2008 where it stays fairly steady, until it starts going down in 2010."
It starts raising again to nearly 50% in 2013.
Palestinian unemployment rates reached an all time high in the Gaza Strip territory at about 45%.
The West Bank territories are at a much lower 12%.
Both territory unemployment rates initially rose to 32% for the Gaza Strip and 19% for West Bank territories in 1996 before dropping their lowest low.
Both the West Bank and Gaza Strip territories unemployment rates dropped their lowest between 1996 to 2000 with the Gaza Strip reaching 18% and West Bank 9%.
The West Bank territory rates have been on a steady decline since 2002 when they hit a peak of about 28%.
"Unlike the West Bank territory, the Gaza Strip territory rates fluctuated between 2002 and 2007 where they rose to about 35% and dropped to 28-30% twice in a row."
Both territory unemployment rates initially rose to 32% for the Gaza Strip and 19% for West Bank territories before dropping.
"The lowest unemployment rates have been in 1999 for both Palestinian Territories, 20 percent for Gaza Strip, 10 percent for the West Bank."
"The highest unemployment rate for Gaza Strip is in 2014 at 45 percent, while 30 percent for The West Bank in 2002."
"The Gaza Strip and West Bank, being at different Unemployment numbers, such numbers fluctuates the same way, from 1995 to 2000."
"For both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, we can notice the spike in 1996, then going down again in 1999, then spike at 2002 and somewhat the same numbers until 2013, where the Gaza Strip gains but the West Bank continues to decline."
"Before the year 2000, both territories reached their lowest numbers."
"The unemployment rate in Gaza Strip decreased from 30% to less than 20% between 1996 and 1999, to rise again and reach almost 40% in 2002."
"The rate kept going up and down from about 30% to 35% until 2013, and then increased to about 45% in 2014."
"The unemployment rate in West Bank decreased from 20% to 10% between 1996 and 1999, then it rose and reached almost 30% in 2002."
"This is in contrast to what was seen in the West Bank territory, where the unemployment rate constantly decreased during these years and never rose again."
Both unemployment rates seem to run parallel up to 2007.
"From 2007 unemployment rates in Gaza Strip clearly went up, while the rates in West Bank remained quite stable."
Unemployment rates in Gaza Strip tend to undergo more sudden changes that their West Bank counterpart.
"In 2004, unemployment rates have skyrocketed to 45% in Gaza Strip while rates in West Bank have gone below 20%."
"Latest unemployment rates suggest a minimum of 25% difference between territories, with West Bank holding the advantage."
"Both graphs have a similar development until 2003, with the West Bank always having a slightly lower unemployment."
"For both regions, the unemployment rate was the lowest in 1999."
"In the West Bank, the unemployment rate has been decreasing slowly since 2003."
"In the Gaza Strip, the unemployment rate ranges from 30 to roughly 45 percent from 2003 to 2011."
There was a slow increase in unemployment in the Gaza strip from 2011 to 2013 and a steep increase from 2013 onward.
"Throughout, the Gaza Strip has the higher unemployment than the West Bank."
The Gaza Strip also had also many ups and downs each year.
The Gaza Strip had its lowest unemployment rate registered between 1996 and 1999.
The Gaza Strip had its highest unemployment rate registered in 2014.
The West Bank had the lowest unemployment rate throughout.
There's also a declining trend in the West Bank between 1996 and 1999 registering the lowest rate of unemployment.
In the West Bank the lowest rate was registered in 1999.
The West Bank began trending downward in 2002.
From 1995 to 2002 the pattern of unemployment rates in the Gaza Strip and The West Bank was similar.
"However, in 2002 the unemployment in the West Bank has decreased to 18%."
"Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, the rate of unemployment has been going up and down from 2002 to 2011."
Since 2011 there have been more unemployed people in Gaza Strip than in The West Bank.
In 2014 the unemployment in The West Bank is 15 % but in Gaza Strip 45%.
"The West Bank has a far more consistent unemployment rate, whereas the Gaza Strip is much more up and down."
Both had major spikes in 2002.
"When the Gaza Strip unemployment spiked post 2002, the West Bank unemployment does the opposite."
"A multi-line plot entitled “Average Labor Force Participation by Genders, 1991-2017” that plots Labor Force Participation Rate by Year."
The Labor Force Participation Rate is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 40 to 80.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 1990 to 2018.
Male is plotted in blue and Female is plotted in pink.
The average labor force participation for women has risen dramatically.
The average labor force participation for man has lowered slightly.
The average for both genders started in 1991 with a very wide gap between the two (about 70% for men and 50% for women).
The average labor force participation for women has had a peak in 2016 and then continued to raise progressively.
"The average labor force participation for men has had a couple of peaks in 1993 and 1996, but it has gradually decreased over the years."
The average for the two genders are now very similar and both seem to be rising.
The rate of female participation in the labor force has increased significantly and steadily over the course of 16 years.
"Comparatively, the rate of male participation in the labor force has decreased and stagnated, but still has a majority in the labor force."
This trend suggests that women have been hired at a much higher rate than ever before.
The difference in 2017 between the two sexes is incredibly close to the number of females coming within 2 percent of males.
"As time goes on, we might project that the rate of female participation in the labor force may be higher than the rate for males."
"Since 1991, more women are joining the workforce."
"Since 1991, fewer men are joining the workforce."
The rate of labor force participation by gender is beginning to look more equal.
We can see that as the years go by and the labor force participation rate for woman in the world has been changing: their participation has been increasing dramatically.
By contrast the labor force participation rate for men has decreased a a little bit.
Difference in labor force participation rate between males and females has decreased to be almost equal in the last 30 years.
"This difference decrease is due to high increase in female participation, from 50% to 66%, and small decrease in male participation, from 71% to 68%."
The male rate is still a little higher than female rate in 2017.
The tendency seems to be equal values in the near future.
"The female labor force participation increased over the years, in contrast to the male rate which decreased."
In the upcoming years females may have higher rate of labor force participation.
"In the year of 1990, it is seen that this is where women began to gain jobs."
As time passes the female rate has some slight peaks and troughs (either due to cultural differences other reasons).
"Since 1990 the male labor force participation rate has been highest overall, but it is slightly decreasing (possibly due to the greater participation in the labor force by women)."
The trend suggests that in the future there will be a point where the male and female rates are roughly equal.
In 1996 both Genders went up significantly at the same time.
In 2017 both male and female rates were beginning to increases.
1996 has a peak for both female and male rates.
At the beginning of the timeline (in 1990) the female labor participation rate was dramatically less than the male rate.
The female rate seems to be catching up to the male one toward the end of the timeline (in 2018).
The female rate is more unstable than the male rate.
"Overall, the male rate is higher than the female rate in every year."
"After year 1996, male labor force participation decreased."
"After year 2002, female labor force participation increased."
At highest point male labor force participation was around 71.
At highest point female labor force participation was around 66.
At the end of visualization male labor participation started to increase.
"A line plot entitled “Auto industry employment has grown since the rescue” and subtitled “Total private payrolls in motor vehicles and parts (manufacturing and retail trade), seasonally-adjusted”."
"The number of payrolls is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 2,200 to 2,450 in Thousands of payrolls."
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from Jan 2009 to 2012.
"An annotation reads: “Auto industry employment +207,600 since June 2009”."
Another annotation indicates the time “Post-restructuring of GM & Chrysler after June 2009”.
"The number of payrolls in the auto industry has grown dramatically since June 2009, when GM and Chrysler were restructured."
This indicates a significant rebound from earlier in 2009 when the number of payrolls fell off steeply.
"Since the restructuring, employment in the auto industry has continued to grow linearly."
In June 2019 the auto industry employment hit the the bottom rock.
Since June 2019 employment in the auto industry had a steep rise.
"Over 207,600 people have been employed since June 2019."
There is still a continuous rise in employment in 2012.
There is a huge decrease in the employment rates of the auto industry at around June 2009.
"After the huge drop, the rate of employment has been steadily rising."
"By 2012, there are over 2,450 payrolls."
"In the middle of 2009, before the restructuring of GM & Chrysler, the number of payrolls was very low, reaching the lowest point at 2,250 thousands of payrolls."
"Post the restructuring of GM & Chrysler, the values sky-rocketed, reaching the highest point in 2012 with more that 2,450 thousands of payrolls."
Employment in the auto-industry decreased significantly in early 2009 (likely due to the financial crisis).
Employment then rebounded to higher-than-before after the restructuring of GM and Chrysler.
The graph shows how the restructuring of GM and Chrysler contributed to gains in auto-industry employment.
"However, the graph only shows part of the information: if the y-axis started from zero (and not at 2,200) the difference would not look as significant."
Since The financial crisis the auto industry employment levels have risen consistently each year.
"From a low of 2,250 in 2009 to a high of 2,450 in 2012."
"The financial crisis of 2008 hit the car industry hard with over 100,000 losing their jobs in one year."
"However, since the start of the graph in Jan 2009, there has been a net increase in employment of 60,000 jobs."
This shows that the auto industry has recovered from the lows experienced in the financial crisis.
"Employment steadily decreased until 2009 when it had an all-time low around 2,250."
"Then, after the rescue, it began to increase until it reached it's all time high in 2012 at 2,450."
"In the first half of 2009 the auto industry suffered a steep drop in payroll from just under 2,400 to 2,250."
"During the second half of 2009 it went up, but also decreased again slightly at one point (but never to below the previous lowest level)."
"Between 2010 and 2012 it went up steeply to over 2,450, higher than its previous highest level in 2009."
From the start of 2009 to June there is a sharp fall of almost 150k jobs.
"Immediately after the restructuring, there is a rise in employment, but this doesn't rise steadily and even starts to decline."
The rest of 2009 has jobs wibbling about but not showing a clear up or down trend.
In 2010-2011 the upward trending of jobs becomes clear; the upward trend continues in 2011-2012.
"At the start of 2011, the employment figures get back to where they were at the start of 2009, and keep going up."
A multi-line chart entitled “Lower and Delay the Epidemic Peak” that plots the number of cases by the time since first case.
The number of cases is plotted on the vertical y-axis.
The Time since first case is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.
One of the lines is dotted and represents “uncontrolled transmission”.
Another line is solid and represents “with controls”.
"A horizontal dashed line represents “healthcare system capacity (ICUs, ER visits, etc.)”."
An annotation reads “control measures slow the spread of disease and reduce burden on hospitals.”
The visualization shows the course of an epidemic for both with and without implementation of control measures.
The number of cases rises sharply with very little time and peaks earlier in the case of uncontrolled transmissions.
Uncontrolled transmissions cause great stress to the healthcare system due to an overwhelming amount of infections.
The number of cases rises slowly and peaks later for an epidemic where control measures are implemented.
"The healthcare systems are not stressed as easily when control measures are implemented, and coping with the epidemic becomes possible."
"We can observe that in both cases,controlled and uncontrolled transmission, the limit of the healthcare system has been reached."
In the uncontrolled transmission the epidemic raised in a very little amount of time and has surpassed way over the point that the healthcare system can handle and can is completely devastated by it.
"On the other hand, we can see that on the peek of the controlled transmission the healthcare system can handle it and help those who are sick from the virus."
"From the visualization we can see and learn that following all the measures such as, handwashing, teleworking, minimizing travel, avoiding crowded gatherings and many more, can limit the spread of the epidemic and help the healthcare system to succeed and help everyone."
The most important variable in this visualization is the time: the epidemic can do most damage in a short amount of time if it is allowed to spread uncontrolled.
"If we can control its spread, then we will have more time to deal with it and suppress it."
"From the time of the first case, if control measures are not included the number of cases rise steeply until saturation is reached, greatly exceeding capacity of the healthcare system."
The number of cases eventually decreases and/or rate of transmission eventually slows down.
"With control measures put in place, the number of cases increase steadily but at a much lower rate and only slightly rises to the capacity of the healthcare system."
"With controls, the number of cases are a lot less and transmission rate is much lower but for a longer period of time."
"Without control measures the spread of the disease increases exponentially, making it harder to slow down and creating a big overload in the healthcare system."
Control measures provide security and protection to society.
"If the transmission is uncontrolled, the epidemic ends sooner."
"If the transmission is controlled, the epidemic ends later."
"If the transmission is uncontrolled, there are more simultaneous cases."
"If the transmission is controlled, there are fewer simultaneous cases."
"If the transmission is uncontrolled, the healthcare system cannot support all the cases."
"If the transmission is controlled, the healthcare system can support all the cases."
"The use of control measures allows us to support all the cases over time, although the epidemic may last longer."
With all control measures in place transmission can be suppressed to a level that is within the healthcare system's capacity.
With control measures the spread will be much slower and more controlled than if there are no control measures.
"Without any control measures, the disease spreads at a pace way higher than what the healthcare system can handle."
"Taking the necessary measures, the system is still slightly overflowed by patients, but it is considerably easier to manage."
Without control measures the number of cases greatly exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system.
"With control measures, the number of cases never greatly exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system."
"The pandemic might last long with control measures in place, but more lives will be saved."
The healthcare system capacity will break if the virus is left uncontrolled.
"The number of cases is dramatically higher without controls, and this will likely lead to many deaths."
"In contrast, when controlled, the healthcare system capacity can handle all of the cases over a longer period of time, and this will save lives."
The chart shows two possible extremes of the rate of rise and decline of COVID-19 cases.
"The purpose of the chart is not to provide exact numbers, but to communicate to the public that there are multiple ways the current crisis can play out."
"A red gradient is used on the ""uncontrolled"" curve to emphasize the severity of how much the health system will be overloaded."
Even the best case controlled scenario predicts that the healthcare system will be overloaded a little bit at the peak.
"The controlled scenario suggests a slower rise AND a quicker decline, while the worst-case uncontrolled scenario shows a bell curve shape with a rapid and disastrous rise followed by a steep decline at the same rate."
A multi-line chart entitled “US ad spending forecast” that plots spending by year.
Ad spending is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to $100 billion.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2010 to 2019.
"Different media are encoded by different colors: TV (light blue), Print (dark blue), Mobile (light purple), and All digital (dark purple)."
The TV industry maintained consistent ad spending rates when compared to other industries in US.
The mobile industry had a great rise in ad spending.
The money spent on ads in the print industry is declining in US.
The digital industry has the highest money spent on ads and this suggests that advertisers view digital as the future.
The ad spending for TV has risen gradually from around 60 billion to 75 billion from 2010 to 2019.
This was the smallest increase of the media types that increased.
"For example, All Digital ad spending increased rapidly from 25 billion to around 90 billion in this time period."
Initially Mobile increased steadily but from 2014 it increased rapidly until 2019.
"By contrast, Print has been steadily decreasing."
It could be concluded that Digital media (such as TV advertising and particularly Mobile) in recent years is more popular and is now taking over traditional Print media.
Mobile and All Digital ad spending forecasts have grown significantly.
"TV and Print ad spending forecasts have mostly stayed the same, with TV increasing slightly and Print declining slightly."
Mobile ad spending in the US has risen due to the number of people with access to a mobile phone increasing.
Mobile ad spending in the US has increased due to the growth of platforms like Facebook and YouTube.
"For the most part, TV is the primary medium for advertisement in the US, and remained consistent through 2010 to 2019."
All Digital ad spending rose by 50% from 2010 to 2019.
Mobile ad spending in the US has been rising rapidly since 2014.
There is a slow decline of Print ad spending.
All Digital ad spending has been rapidly increasing.
"The spending on TV ads in the US was forecasted to increase, at a relatively constant rate from 2010 to 2019."
"The spending on mobile ads in the US was forecasted to decrease, at a relatively constant rate from 2010 to 2019."
The spending on All Digital ads in the US was forecasted to increase at a higher rate than TV.
Mobile was forecasted to barely be a present ad market to increase considerably.
"The increase in Mobile ad spending was expected to show an increasing marginal change until 2016, where the marginal increase would diminish somewhat."
The All Digital and Mobile ad spending forecasts show a higher marginal increase rate than the TV ad spending.
Print ad spending is the only variable with an expected negative tendency.
The forecast suggests that the market for All Digital and Mobile advertisements would grow considerably.
"The forecast suggests that the market for TV advertisements would grow constantly, but less than for Mobile and All Digital."
The market for Print is expected to decrease.
The forecast displays expected trends in the market.
"US ad spending forecast in the past decade for various media has: gradually and slightly declined for Print, gradually and slightly increased for TV, been on an upward trajectory for Mobile from its inception at the beginning of the decade, and moved in a linearly increasing trend for All Digital."
"Overall, ad spending is higher than ever."
Ad spending for All Digital media is approx 3.75 times the amount at the beginning of the decade.
The US ad spending for Mobile and All Digital has risen sharply over the years.
Print has been slowly declining.
TV has a constant rise.
All Digital started with little ad spending (around $25 billion) and evolved surpassing all others (almost $100 billion).
The biggest ad spending belongs to Mobile and All Digital.
Mobile has grown by almost $60 billion in 9 years.
"All Digital devices have also had a large increase in the last 9 years, spending $50 billion since 2010."
TV was spending almost the same amount on ads in 2019 than they were in 2010.
Print media is the only one that has decreased in ad spending.
"This suggests that companies are buying ads in All Digital and Mobile media, likely because social media is becoming more and more popular amongst people."
"However, Print is not as popular as it used to be, that's why companies are not buying ads in print media."
The US ad spending in Print media is in constant decline.
The US ad spending in All Digital is the highest as of 2019.
"The All Digital US ad spending is on a linear growth trend, surpassing the ad spending on TV by the end of 2016."
"The TV ad spending shows the lowest amount of growth (excluding Print, which is in constant decline)."
Mobile ad spending has also seen a linear increase.
A multi-line chart entitled “US unemployment rate by race/ethnicity” that plots unemployment rate by year.
The unemployment rate is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 20%.
The Year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2015.
"Different racial demographics are encoded by different colors: Black (light blue), Hispanic/Latino (medium blue), White (dark blue), and Asian (darkest blue)."
Companies tend to not hire Black and Hispanic/Latino people.
White and Asian people have lower rates of unemployment.
Black people have the highest unemployment rate over the years compared to others.
Asian people has the lowest unemployment rate over the years compared to others.
The unemployment rate was highest around 2009 to 2011 for all races/ethnicities.
The unemployment rate started to decrease steadily for all races/ethnicities in the year 2012.
There was a rise in unemployment for every race through the 2008 recession and have since almost recovered by 2015.
Black people have the highest unemployment rate.
"White and Asian people have very similar, low unemployment rates at around 4%."
Black and Hispanic/Latino people have the highest unemployment rates in the US.
Through 2006 to 2015 there is still a huge disparity in employment between the Black and White people.
"Although the percentage of unemployment changes through the years, Black people are the most affected by unemployment."
Unemployment for all races peaked between 2010 and 2011.
The lowest rates of unemployment for all races were between 2007 and 2008.
Black and Hispanic/Latino people have the highest rates of unemployment.
Black people have the highest unemployment rates every single year.
Hispanic/Latino people have the 2nd to highest unemployment rates every single year.
"Most of the years, White people have the 2nd to lowest unemployment rates."
"Most of the years, Asian people have the lowest unemployment rates."
"For a small period of time around 2014, White people had a lower unemployment rate than Asian people."
There was a spike in unemployment for all races/ethnicities between 2007 and around 2010.
"Since 2010, the unemployment rates for all races/ethnicities gradually dropped."
The highest unemployment rate of all time was a little over 16% for Black people.
The lowest unemployment rate of all time was a little under 4% for Asian people.
"The unemployment rate in the US has, throughout all the years between 2006-2015, been the highest for Black people."
"The unemployment rate in the US has, throughout all the years between 2006-2015, been the second-highest for Latino or Hispanic people."
"On average in the time period, people Asian people had the lowest unemployment rate."
"The variation within White people, tends to be considerably less than for the other ethnicities."
The variation for Latino and Hispanic people decreased from about 2011.
The unemployment rate across all the ethnicities in the table increased considerably between 2008 and 2010.
"After 2010, the unemployment rate has gradually sunk towards the level observed before the 2008-increase."
The increase in 2008 was likely due to the financial crisis.
"During the financial crisis, the rate of employment for Hispanic/Latino people diverged more from the rates of White and Asian people."
"The Black community is the one that suffers unemployment the most, meanwhile White and Asian people are the most favored by the system."
"Around the year 2006, there was a clear inequality between races, however the unemployment rates were all pretty low."
"From 2008 these rates started increasing very drastically (especially for Black and Hispanic/Latino people), reaching their peak in the year 2010."
"Since then, they started decreasing until they reached levels similar to those in 2006."
The US employment rate tends to increase and decrease with respect to race and year.
"Black, Hispanic/Latino, White and Asian unemployment tends to increase from year 2009 to 2012 with a slight decrease from 2012."
The unemployment rates in the US seems to be improving for all races in recent years.
Unemployment peaked for all races in 2010.
Unemployment increased sharply in 2009 for all races.
From 2010 to 2015 it appears that unemployment has been decreasing gradually for all races.
"Unemployment is consistently highest for Black people, second highest for Hispanic/Latino people, third highest for White people and lowest for Asian people."
"While all four lines follow the same general increases and decreases, the lines for Black, Hispanic/Latino and Asian people all have similar smaller peaks and troughs, while the line for White people tends to be smoother overall."
"At one point in 2014, unemployment for Asian people temporarily increased above that of White people."
At the beginning of 2009 all races/ethnicities experienced very high unemployment rate.
Black people suffer the most from unemployment.
"Except for White people, the unemployment rate is very shaky."
This very chart might suggest how systematic racism is a factor in employment.
"For all races, the highest unemployment rate was in 2010 to 2012."
"For all races, the lowest unemployment rate was before 2009."
Black people have the highest unemployment rates overall.
Asian people have the lowest unemployment rates overall.
Since 2012 the unemployment rate is going down consistently for all races.
In 2016 none of the races has an unemployment rate over 10%.
"A multi-line plot entitled “Difference in Unemployment Rate Between Genders, United States vs."
World”.
The y-axis plots Women Unemployment Rate - Men Unemployment Rate (%) from -2.0 to 1.5 with an increment of 0.5.
The x-axis plots the year from 1990 to 2018 with an increment of 1.
The Worldwide Average (in orange) and the United States (in green).
"A dashed horizontal black line at 0.0 represents an Equal Unemployment Rate, and separates the Higher Female Unemployment region from the Higher Male Unemployment region"
"Generally, the United States has a lower unemployment rate for women than the rest of the world."
"In 2008, the United States experienced a very high employment rate for males."
The highest employment rate for women in the United States occurred in 2000.
"The women/men unemployment ratio for the United States follows general trends of the curve for the global unemployment women/men unemployment ratio, except for in 2008 when male unemployment was much higher."
"Generally, the female unemployment rate has remained more consistent than the male unemployment."
In 2009 the unemployment rate of the males increased almost 2 points since the year before.
"Two years later, the unemployment rate of the males bounced back by decreasing 2 points."
"Worldwide, women are consistently more unemployed than men since 1990."
"In the United States, the unemployment rates for men and women is more volatile."
The USA is much less constant in the women/men unemployment rate.
The United States always has a higher male unemployment rate than female unemployment.
The US experienced a much higher peak in male unemployment than the Worldwide average in 2009.
"Typically the US follows the general trend of the Worldwide average across the span of the years (1990 to 2018), except for in 2008-2011."
"From 2016 onwards, male and female unemployment rates are more equal in the United States than Worldwide."
"The world average shows that, in general, there were more unemployed women than men."
"The U.S. average shows that, even though from 1995 to 2001 there were more unemployed women, in general there were more unemployed men."
"This might be due to the fact that women started working more after the feminist revolution, but since there is still employment discrimination in some jobs, women might be more willing to do jobs that provide a lower income."
The Worldwide average unemployment rate for women is consistently higher than in the United States.
"In the United States, the unemployment rate is consistently higher for men, but sometimes comes close to equal unemployment for men and women."
At a few points (1995-200 and 2005-2006) the unemployment rate is higher for women in the United States.
"In 2008, the unemployment rate shifted greatly toward men in the United States, but not in the rest of the World."
"This doesn't necessarily mean that the 2008 unemployment rate for men didn't also increase in other countries, because the Worldwide average is an aggregated measure from multiple countries, which can confuse the reading."
"The female unemployment rate is consistently higher Worldwide than in the United States, and it remains steady across time, maybe increasing slightly."
"On the other hand, the male unemployment rate is higher in the United States, although it as decreases over time to almost being equal to female unemployment."
The unemployment rate for men is greater than the unemployment rate for women in the United States.
"Worldwide, there are more unemployed women than men."
From 1995 to 2001 there were more unemployed women than men in the US.
"In 2009, the United States exhibited the highest difference in unemployment rate between genders."
The Worldwide average of the difference in unemployment rates between genders is stable.
In this multi-line plot.
"Worldwide, the unemployment rate for women stayed relatively stable from 1990 to 2018."
"Meanwhile, in the United States, the male unemployment had very different stages depending on the year."
"For example, during the year 2000, there was the less male unemployment, while in 2009 the male unemployment reached his peak at -2.0%."
"A multi-line chart entitled “UK consumer price index inflation, annual” which shows the percent consumer price index inflation by year."
The percent inflation is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 6%.
The year is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 2006 to 2015.
The purple line represents overall inflation.
"The blue line represents inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco."
"In years 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, overall inflation was huge with food, energy, alcohol and tobacco being the biggest influencers."
"This seems to be a general trend of all the years except in 2014-2015+ since the overall inflation went down but inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco remained relatively consistent."
This could be due the nature of these goods being somewhat a necessity and habit forming that is harder to quit.
"Thus, inflation can remain relatively stable because people will still buy these goods because they are addicted to them, or need them in order to survive."
"The overall inflation was maximum in the year 2008-2009 then it gradually decreased, but again it increased to 5% in the year 2011-2012."
"Then till 2015, the total inflation rate has gradually decreased and a negative inflation rate has been observed after 2016."
"Excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco the inflation trend is similar but at least 50% less than the overall inflation."
"Interestingly, in the year 2015-2016, the inflation overall rate drops below the rate that excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco."
The Overall inflation rate was its highest in 2008-2009 and 2012.
This could be due to the 2008-2009 global recession.
The Overall inflation rate reached its lowest point after 2015.
"The visualization suggests that most of the inflation rate is due to inflation in food, energy, alcohol and tobacco."
"However, this has been changing in recent years, when the Overall inflation rate drops below the rate that excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco."
"Overall, there was a large upwards spike in between the middle of 2007 and 2008 and the middle of 2008 and 2009."
"Overall, there was a large downwards spike in between the middle of 2008 and 2009 and the middle of 2009 and 2010."
Both the purple and blue lines have a general zig-zag shape.
"The purple line (Overall inflation) has larger spikes than the blue line (inflation rate excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco)."
The peak of the purple line is a value a little above 5%.
The peak of the blue line is about 3.5%.
The lowest value of the purple line is a little below 0%.
The lowest value of the blue line is a little below 1%.
"The Overall inflation rate and the inflation rate excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco have remained fairly consistent over time."
"However, the Overall rate greatly exceeds the excluded rate in 2008-2009, suggesting that the inflation for food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco increased significantly during these years."
The overall inflation reaches it's highest point at the end of both 2008 and 2011.
"The inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco reaches it's highest point mid 2011."
The overall inflation reaches it's lowest point the year 2015.
"The inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco reaches it's lowest point the year 2015."
"There is a clear correlation between both inflations: if one goes down, so does the other, and similarly if one goes up."
"The biggest difference between the purple and blue lines took place around mid 2008, where there was a 3% difference."
"Almost every year, the purple line (Overall inflation) is higher than the blue line (inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco)."
"Near the end of 2014, the purple line started going lower than the blue one."
The blue line is more stable than the purple one.
"The purple line was at the highest percentage mid 2008, and near the end of 2011."
The purple line was at the lowest in 2015.
The blue line peaked high in mid 2011.
Both lines seem to follow a pattern where they grow and then they go down together.
There are two major spikes in the Overall inflation rate in 2008 and 2011.
Recently they are making cigarettes and alcohol more expensive so there is less consumption which reflects why the Overall rate is lower in more recent years (2014-2015).
There was an Overall decrease in inflation from 2006 to 2015.
"Around the middle of 2008, there was an extreme peak on the price index inflation if we include food, energy, alcohol and tobacco."
"In middle 2009 the inflation excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco was actually higher than the one taking it into account."
"Since that time, there was a small peak on both cases that seemed to come crashing down in later years."
A multi-line chart entitled “Opioid pills sold over time in West Virginia” that plots pills by distributor sold by year.
"The distributors (and their colors) include Actavis Pharma (teal)., Amneal Pharmaceuticals (blue), Par Pharmaceutical (orange), Purdue Pharma (red), and SpecGx LLC (pink)."
The horizontal y-axis plots the year from 2006 to 2014 with an increment of 1.
The vertical y-axis plots the number of opioid pills sold from 0K to 400K with an increment of 50K.
"From 2006 to 2014, distributor SpecGx LLC consistently sold the greatest number of opioid pills."
The number of pills sold by Purdue Pharma LP has remained almost even throughout years.
"Since year 2009, the number of opioid pills sold by SpecGx LLC decreased, but the number of pills sold by Par Pharmaceutical and Amneal Pharmaceuticals increased."
Actavis Pharma experienced rapid decline in sales in 2013.
"In year 2009, SpecGx LLC sold more pills than in any other year."
Overall all the distributors selling opioid pills do not have the same trend across the years from 2006 to 2014.
Some of their trends differ.
"For example, Par Pharmaceutical and Amneal Pharmaceuticals show an increase in sales between 2013 and 2014."
"Whereas, Actavis Pharma and SpecGX LLC show a decrease in sale between 2013 and 2014."
Purdue Pharma has a steady constant sale rate across the years 2006-2014.
"Overall, SpecGX LLC has the highest sales in opioids compared to the other distributors, selling anything between 250K and 400K pills."
"Purdue Pharma has the lowest at any year between 2006 and 2014, selling less than 50K pills."
The maximum number of opioid pills sold 400k.
The minimum number of opioid pills sold is close to 0K.
SpecGx LLC consistently sells more opioid pills than the other distributors.
"The maximum opioid pills were sold by space GX LLC in the year 2009 (400K pills), and after that their sales began to decline to 250K in the year 2014."
"The sales of Par Pharmaceutical were initially much less (75K), but their sales have increased to 200K in the year 2012 and after that have fluctuated some are stable overall."
"The sales of Actavis Pharma remain stable at 150K till 2013 but after that, they reduce drastically to 50K."
"The sales of Amneal Pharmaceuticals increased to 50K in the year 2010, and after years of fluctuation, exceed the 50K mark in the year 2014."
"The sales of Purdue Pharma remain minimal compared to the other distributors, and their maximum sales never reaches 25K."
SpecGX LLC (in pink) sells the most pills overall.
Purdue Pharma LP (in red) stays steady with a limited number of sells over the years.
"Actavis Pharma (in green) has consistently moderate sales, but in the last few years their sales dropped off."
"Amneal Pharmaceuticals (in blue) has consistently lower sales, but have begun to increase in recent years."
Purdue Pharma LP has had consistently low sales over the course of the 8 years.
Amneal Pharmaceutical LLS for the first 4 years had lower numbers than Purdue and grew higher until 2010 and has since had highs and lows but is still lower than the others.
"Par Pharmaceuticals is placed in the middle, it had a constant growth until 2012 then in 2013 it dropped a bit, it surpassed Actavis Pharma Inc from the middle of 2010 to the middle of 2012 ."
"Actavis Pharma Inc has had the most consistent number, growing about only 50k over 7 years and having a deep drop from almost 200k to around 80k (for most of the time it had bigger numbers than the previously mentioned distributors)."
"SpecGX LLC has had the highest sales overall, the earliest growth, and the worst decline, but was never surpassed by the other distributors."
SpecGX LLC started at 270k sold in 2006 and grew to 400k in 2008-2009 and then got lower every year and ended up at 250k in 2014.
"Sales for opioid pills dropped over time for Actavis and SpecGx (and slightly for Purdue), but have risen for the other companies."
"Drops in sales are most likely related to the opioid crisis in the US, where generic drug manufacturers actually sold most of the pills."
The largest distributor is by far SpecGx LLC.
"Throughout the analyzed period, this company sold the largest amount of the product."
Purdue Pharma LP is a stable company when it comes to the amount of opioids sold (almost a horizontal line).
"The period 2008-2009, during which SpecGx achieved the maximum of its sales, may be due to the opioid crisis in West Virginia."
The sales of Purdue Pharma LP remain at similar levels as the years before.
"SpecGx LLC has the highest number of sales out of all the distributors, at any given year."
"Actavis Pharma INC. also stays at similar sale levels from 2006 to 2013, but that the sales started dropping from 2013 to 2014."
Actavis Pharma INC. has the third highest sales point of the 5 distributors.
Actavis Pharma INC. has the third lowest sales point of the 5 distributors.
"Par Pharmaceutical has rising sales from 2006 to 2012, a drop from 2012 to 2013 and rising sales again from 2013 to 2014."
Par Pharmaceutical has the second highest sales point of the 5 distributors.
Par Pharmaceutical has the fourth lowest sales point of the 5 distributors.
"Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC has rising sales from 2006 to 2010, dropping sales from 2010 to 2012 and rising sales from 2012 to 2014."
Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC has the fourth highest sales point of the 5 distributors.
Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC has the fourth lowest sales point of the 5 distributors.
Purdue Pharma LP has rising sales from 2006 to 2008 and dropping sales from 2008 to 2014.
Purdue Pharma LP has the fifth highest sales point of the 5 distributors.
Purdue Pharma LP has the second lowest sales point of the 5 distributors.
"SpecGx LLC has rising sales from 2006 to 2009, dropping sales from 2009 to 2010, rising sales from 2010 to 2011 and dropping sales from 2011 to 2014."
SpecGx LLC has the first highest sales point of the 5 distributors.
SpecGx LLC has the fifth lowest sales point of the 5 distributors.
SpecGx LLC sold the most opioid pills over time.
Purdue Pharma LP sold the least opioid pills over time.
SpecGx LLC is the major distributor of Opioid Pills in West Virginia.
SpecGX LLC sold the most opioid pills over time.
Purdue Pharma sold the least amount of opioid pills over eight year period shown.
"With the exception of Amneal and Par Pharmaceuticals, the amount of pills sold over time is decreasing with the sharpest decreases in 2013 and 2009."
You could draw the conclusion that in general opioid distribution is going down or remaining steady.
You could also conclude that until 2009 the distribution of opioid drugs remained relatively even with the exception of SpecGx.
The distributor that sold the most opioid pills over time SpecGx LLC as the line was above all the other distributors.
The distributor that sold the least opioid pills over time is Purdue Pharma LP as while it was above Amneal Pharmaceuticals for a little while it maintained the least opioid sold for the majority of the graph from 2009-2014.
"From 2006-2008 the four distributors under SpecGx LLC maintain a steady distribution of opioids, but at 2009 only Purdue Pharma LP seem to maintain that steady distribution afterwards."
The highest distributor SpecGx LLC has a huge increase in 2008 before plateauing and steadily decreasing after 2019.
"Par Pharmaceutical and Actavis Pharma cross around 2010-2011, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014."
Amneal Pharmaceuticals and Purdue Pharma cross only once at 2019 before Amneal increases over Purdue.
SpecGx LLC distributes the most by a length before declining to the other four distributors in recent years.
The other four distributors are broken into two groups: Par Pharmaceutical and Actavis Pharma with Amneal Pharmaceuticals and Purdue Pharma (though Amneal crosses over with Actavis at just before 2014).
"Par and Amneal at 2013 onwards are increasing while Actavis decreases much and Purdue stagnates, SpecGx LLC is also decreasing 2013 onwards."
This could suggest that market for distribution of opioids is becoming more competitive as the distributors start to head towards the same point.
SpecGx LLC sold the most opioids over time and Purdue Pharma LP sold the least.
Amneal Pharmaceuticals and Par Pharmaceutical increased their sales over time.
Actavis Pharma had a sharp downturn in sales from 2013 onwards.
SpecGx LLC sold the most opioid pills over time.
Purdue Pharma LP sold the least opioid pills over time.
"The number of Opioid Pills Sold by SpecGx LLC for each Year at first was rising, from 2006 to 2009, but from 2009 to 2014 number of Opioid Pills Sold by SpecGx LLC for each Year was decreasing."
"The number of Opioid Pills Sold by Actavis Pharma, INC for each Year at first was rising, from 2006 to 2013, but from 2013 to 2014 number of Opioid Pills Sold by Actavis Pharma, INC for each Year was decreasing."
The number of Opioid Pills Sold by Par Pharmaceutical and Amneal Pharmaceuticals for each Year is almost constantly rising.
The number of Opioid Pills Sold by Purdue Pharma LP for each Year is almost constant.
The decreasing Number of Opioid Pills Sold by SpecGx LLC for each Year correlates with increase in sales by the other distributors.
"SpecGx LLC sold the highest amount of opioid pills, and Purdue Pharma LP sold the least amount overall."
"SpecGx LLC seems to occupy most of the opioid drug market, since the gap between all the others is quite large."
"The amount of opioid pills sold by SpecGx LLC has been decreasing since around 2009, but it still sold the most amount in all years."
"Par Pharmaceutical seems to be steadily increasing its sales, though it briefly dropped below Actavis Pharma Inc. between year 2012 and 2013."
"Actavis Pharma Inc. may catch up to SpecGx LLC in a few years, if the most recent trend continues."
Actavis Pharma has a steep drop from year 2013 to 2014.
"They may be having problems in management, production, or marketing."
"SpecGx LLC is still at the top, but its sales have been decreasing steadily since around year 2009."
"If the current trend continues, Par Pharmaceutical may become the top distributor in a few years."
A scatter plot entitled “Old Faithful Eruptions” that plots Waiting Time Between Eruptions (Min) by Eruption Duration (Min).
The Waiting Time Between Eruptions is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 50 to 90 with an increment of 10 minutes.
The Eruption Duration is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 1.5 to 5.0 with an increment of 0.5 minutes.
There are almost no eruptions that last between 2.5 and 4 minutes.
Mostly eruptions last from 4.0 to 5.0 minutes and the waiting time between them is 70 to 90 minutes.
Also a lot of eruptions last from 1.0 to 2.5 minutes and the waiting time between them is 50 to 60 minutes.
There are very few eruptions that happen with a 60 to 70 minute intervals.
"Generally, as waiting time increases the duration of the eruption increases as well."
"When the waiting time is small, the duration of the eruption is also smaller."
The longer the waiting time between eruptions the longer that eruption lasted.
"There are very few eruptions in the middle (i.e., eruptions lasting around 3 minutes, with a waiting time of 70 minutes)."
Most eruptions either have a waiting time of 50 minutes or 80 minutes
"When eruptions are short, it tends to be because the waiting time between them was short."
"So, we can see a trend where the more time waited between eruptions, the longer the eruption duration."
Shorter eruptions have the shortest waiting time.
Longer eruptions have the longest waiting time.
There are many very short eruptions with very short waiting time.
There are many very long eruptions with very long waiting time.
There are not many eruptions in-between.
"If the time between eruptions is longer than 70 minutes, then the second eruption is more likely to be between 4-5 minutes long."
There is a positive correlation between waiting time and eruption duration.
"The general trend is that the higher the waiting time between eruptions, the higher the eruption duration is."
This effect seems to be less prominent when waiting time between eruptions is higher than 75 minutes.
"The variance of the observed eruptions is high, however."
Old faithful eruptions exhibit a scattered increase and decrease in the pattern of waiting time eruptions with the eruption durations.
Eruptions tend to have a waiting time of either 50-60 minutes or 80-90 minutes.
Eruptions tend to have a duration of 1.5-2.5 minutes or 4.0-5.0 minutes.
"The longer waiting time between eruptions, the longer the eruption duration."
There is almost no in-between when it comes to eruption duration.
"The longer the waiting time between eruptions, the longer the eruption duration is."
To see a 5 minute eruption you have to wait at least 75 minutes.
Most eruptions last for 1.5-2.5 and 3.5-5 minutes.
The rarest eruptions last for 3 minutes.
The general trend shows that as the eruption time increases the waiting time between eruptions increases.
"The most common combinations are either very small values for both variables, or very high values for both variables."
There were many more eruptions that lasted longer and had a higher waiting time.
This is a strong positive correlation.
"A scatter plot entitled “Revenue, by Product Family” that plots Revenue in Millions by Units Sold."
The Revenue in Millions is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 16m.
The Units Sold is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0 to 70.
"There are four family types: Family 1 (gray), Family 2 (light orange), Family 3 (medium orange), and Family 4 (dark orange)."
I observe that Family 1 sells the fewest units and therefore has the lowest in revenue.
"The trend is that revenue increases with units sold, and this increases with family number."
Family 4 is the highest earner with over 60 units sold.
The number of units sold and revenue increases with Family number.
Family 1 sold the fewest units and has the lowest revenue at around 4 million dollars.
Family 4 sold the most units and has the highest revenue at around 12 million dollars.
Revenues are positively correlated to the Units Sold.
Family 1 sold the fewest Units among the four Families.
Family 4 sold the most Units among the four Families.
Family 1 has the lowest Revenue.
Family 4 has the highest Revenue.
Family 2 and 3 are in the middle for both Revenue and Unit Sold.
"Family 1 (gray) has the lowest revenue, followed by Family 2 (light orange), followed by Family 3 (medium orange), followed by Family 4 (dark orange)."
The number of units sold also increases with the Family number.
Product Family 4 generates more revenue than all the other product families.
Revenue and units sold are directly proportional.
Family types seem to be sorted by units sold.
Family 1 and 2 products seem to yield more revenue per unit sold despite the low value of total revenue.
Revenue slightly stagnates over 50 units sold.
"The more units sold, the higher the revenue."
Product Family 4 generates the highest revenue and ranks first in terms of number of units sold.
Product Family 3 generates the second-highest revenue and ranks second in terms of units sold.
Product Family 2 generates the third-highest revenue and ranks third in terms of units sold.
Product Family 1 generates the lowest revenue and ranks last in terms of units sold.
Product Family 4 is the one that sells the most and profits the most.
Products in Family 1 appear to be the least sold overall.
The product with the least units sold is from product Family 1.
The product with the most units sold is from product Family 4.
"There appears to be a clear positive correlation between units sold and revenue in millions, therefore suggesting that all products have similar prices."
We can see a gradual increase with the units sold corresponding with the revenue on the left.
Each family has a steady growth although it begins to gradually increase at the end with Family 3 and 4.
Each family has it's own ups and downs but generally they all are on the same pattern with a slight increase with the units sold.
"At first, Family 1 is the starting product family and the rest appear later on."
We can might conclude that after the business grew the number of families increased.
A scatter plot entitled “Gun ownership vs.
"gun deaths, by state” that plots Gun Deaths Per 100,000 by Gun Ownership (% of Households)."
"The Gun Deaths Per 100,000 is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 20."
The Gun Ownership (% of Households) is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0 to 70.
Each data point represents a US state and is labeled with the name of the state.
There is a positive correlation between the percent of households have have guns and gun related deaths.
Wyoming is the state with the highest gun ownership and gun death rate.
Hawaii is the state with the lowest gun ownership and gun death rate.
"On average, more gun ownership correlates to more gun deaths per state."
The state with the highest gun ownership and corresponding gun deaths is Wyoming.
The state with the lowest gun ownership and gun deaths is Hawaii.
"The states with the lowest gun ownership and deaths are geographically on the east coast, apart from Hawaii."
The states with the highest gun ownership and deaths are geographically in the centre of the country.
"As the percentage of homes with gun ownership increases, the percentage of gun killings increases."
Wyoming has the highest percentage of gun killings and has the highest percentage of homes with gun ownership.
Massachusetts has the fewest gun deaths of all the states.
"In Hawaii, there are very few homes with gun ownership, and therefore very few gun deaths."
Louisiana has the highest gun death rate per percent of households.
Minnesota has the lowest gun death rate per percent of households.
"The higher the rate of the gun ownership by household, the higher the number of deaths by gun violence."
"Most states are clustered at in the center of the x-axis (gun ownership as percent of households), with an estimated 40% of gun ownership."
"When there are higher rates of gun ownership, there is a higher tendency for gun deaths to occur."
"Geographically, the states in the center of the country have the most gun ownership and gun deaths."
"Wyoming and Louisiana both have roughly 18 gun deaths per 100,000 people, the most out of all the states."
"Massachusetts has the least number of gun deaths per 100,000 people."
Hawaii has the fewest households with guns percentage-wise.
"There is a positive correlation between the percentage of gun ownership by household and the number of gun deaths per 100,000 people."
"The most gun deaths per 100,000 occurred in Louisiana and Wyoming, but Louisiana had 50% household gun ownership and Wyoming 70% household gun ownership."
"The trend is that when there are higher rates of gun ownership by household, there are more gun deaths."
"But there are some exceptions, such as South Dakota, which where 60% of households own guns, but there are only around 9 deaths per 100,000 people."
"The more households that own guns, the the more gun deaths."
There is a big cluster of states that have around 40% gun ownership.
A scatter plot entitled “Applicants to Columbia University Medical School” that plots applicant MCAT by GPA scores.
MCAT is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 500 to 520.
GPA is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 3.2 to 4.0.
Accepted applicants are plotted in blue.
Rejected applicants are plotted in red.
"The higher your MCAT and GPA are, the more likely you are to be accepted to Columbia University Medical School."
The applicants most likely to be accepted to Columbia University Medical School have a 3.6-4.0 GPA and 510-520 MCAT score.
"However, there are many applicants who fall into these ranges that are not accepted, so there must be other factors that determine whether an applicant is accepted or not."
Applicants who have a very high MCAT score (over 520) are the most likely to get accepted.
"By contrast, applicants who have a middling MCAT score (510-520) have a roughly 50/50 chance of being accepted, while applicants with a score under 510 are very likely to be rejected."
"The higher an applicant's GPA and MCAT score, the greater the chance they have of being accepted, but it is not guaranteed."
Applicants who have a lower GPA have a smaller chance of be accepted to the Columbia University Medical School.
"The applicants with the highest GPA (4.0) have the greatest chance of being accepted, but it also helps if they also have a high MCAT score."
Applicants with a high GPA and MCAT score are most likely to be accepted to the medical school.
It looks like having a very high MCAT score is more important medical school admissions than having a high GPA.
Applicants to Columbia University Medical School with a MCAT of more than 520 and a 4.0 GPA were mostly accepted.
Applicants with less than a 3.2 GPA were all rejected and applicants with a less than a 505 MCAT were all rejected as well.
Applicants who showed both a high GPA and MCAT shows a greater likelihood of being accepted into Colombia University Medical School.
Applicants with a very low score on either test-score tend to be rejected.
"Applicants who scored very high on either test but not the other one, tend to be accepted, however, there are exceptions."
Applicants with a high score of both tests tend to have the best chance of being accepted.
A great proportion of the applicants had an MCAT over 515 and GPA over 3.6.
There is a positive correlation between MCAT score and GPA score.
Applicants with a low or medium score on the tests have a higher likelihood of being rejected.
The data also suggests that there are considerations other than the scores that determines whether an applicant is rejected or not.
The lowest GPA score accepted is slightly above 3.2.
The lowest MCAT accepted is slightly above 505.
Anyone with a score below those mentioned has been rejected.
"Surprisingly, there are applicants with high GPA and MCAT scores who have been rejected, and others with lower ones that have been accepted."
"The reason for this is not specified, but it suggests that there are other reasons why an applicant might be accepted or rejected."
Every applicant that has an MCAT score less than 505 is rejected.
Applicants who have an MCAT score of 510 points or less are usually rejected.
Applicants who have an MCAT score of 520 points or more are usually accepted.
Applicants who have have a GPA of 3.4 or less have a high chance of being rejected.
Applicants who have a GPA of 3.4 or higher seem to have an equal chance of being accepted or rejected.
The MCAT seems like a important factor for admission than the GPA.
The majority of applicants have an MCAT score of 510 to 520 and a GPA of 3.6 to 4.0.
Overall there seems to be a roughly equal number of applicants who are accepted or rejected.
Applicants who have an MCAT score of 520 or higher are much more likely to be accepted to Columbia University Medical School.
There are very few people accepted who have an MCAT score below 510.
Applicants who have a GPA close to 4.0 are more likely to be accepted than rejected.
Any applicant who has a GPA below 3.2 always gets rejected.
Any applicant who has an MCAT score of 505 or below always gets rejected.
"Usually the higher the applicant's GPA and MCAT scores, the higher the odds of them getting accepted into Columbia University Medical School."
There are many fewer rejections for applicants who have a GPA between 3.6-4.0 and who also have an MCAT score 520 or more.
A scatter plot entitled “Relation between proportion of country’s population living in poverty and malaria mortality rates”.
"Malaria death per billion at risk (2010) is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 1 to 1,000,000 on a logarithmic scale."
Proportion of population living on <US$1.25 per day is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0% to 100%.
"Region is encoded by color: African Region (dark brown), Other Regions (light brown)."
"In African regions (except for a few anomalies at just under 1000 malaria deaths per billion), a huge proportion of countries have 10-100% of their population living under 1.25 USD per day."
This has a significant impact on how many Malaria deaths per billion there are in these countries.
It suggests that people are at a much higher risk of dying from Malaria when they have less money to live on.
"Other Regions are more scattered in terms of the proportion of their populations living on less than 1.25 USD per day, but the trend is that the poorer the population, the greater their risk of dying from Malaria."
Malaria deaths appear to be higher in countries with a high percentage of population living in poverty.
"African regions are much more likely to be impoverished, and therefore much more likely to have many deaths due to Malaria."
There are few instances of high Malaria deaths in African countries where the percentage of poor population is lower.
"There is more concentration of data in the upper right part of the chart (where a country's population is more impoverished, and has a high rate of malaria deaths per billion)."
The African Region have a much higher count of Malaria deaths in proportion to the other countries.
"There is a positive correlation between a country's level of poverty, and the number of malaria deaths within that country."
"People in African regions mostly live off less than 1.25 USD, and are more likely to have more malaria deaths per billion."
"When 90% or more of the population lives under 1.25 USD, malaria deaths per billion is much greater in African regions compared to Other Regions."
This could be due to poor healthcare.
There is a strong positive correlation between the proportion of the population living on under 1.25 USD and malaria deaths per billion at risk.
African regions have a higher percentage of the population living in poverty.
People living in poverty are more likely to die from Malaria.
African regions are more prone to poverty.
Countries in the African Region has both higher mortality rates from malaria and a higher proportion of the population living on <1.25 USD per day.
The relationship between malaria deaths and proportion of the population living below 1.25 USD per day is positive and linear.
"We notice the density of the plot is mostly situated on the top right of the plot, where poverty rates and maralia deaths are highest."
The positive linear regression isn't entirely representative.
We notice that the African Regions are a majority in the upper right corner of the plot.
There aren't many other African Regions on the three other quarters of the plot.
"We see that the poorer population, the more likely they are to be victims of Malaria."
"Since most countries in the African Region are on the upper right, these countries have populations that are very poor, and also the most likely victims of Malaria."
We can conclude there is a positive relation between poor population and malaria death.
Malaria deaths increase as the proportion of population living in <US$1.25 per day increases.
"The average is an increasing linear trend: as poverty increases, malaria deaths also increse."
There are far fewer countries in the African Region that have a 10% or less proportion of their population living on <US$1.25 per day.
"The majority of countries clustered around 100,000 malaria deaths per billion are from the African Region."
The majority of countries in the African Region have around 70% of their population living on less than 1.25 USD.
"This corresponds to high rates of death from malaria (around 100,000 deaths per billion)."
"On the other hand, the majority of countries in Other Regions have less than 70% of their population living on less than 1.25 USD."
"This corresponds to lower rates of death from malaria (around 10,000 or less per billion)."
"This suggests that when a country's population lives on less money, they have a higher risk of dying from malaria."
The plot suggests that people living in poverty have a much higher risk of dying from malaria.
"According to the scatter plot, we can see that in regions in which poverty is higher, so is the risk of dying from malaria."
"This is especially true in the Africa Region, where the mortality rate surpasses even the expected proportional rate, meaning that it could very well be an exponential growth in the death rate, relating to poverty and other conditions in those countries."
"A scatter plot entitled “Proportion of the population sleeping under an ITN, by urban and rural areas and by older and more recent surveys”."
Proportion of the urban population sleeping under an ITN is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0% to 100%.
Proportion of rural population sleeping under an ITN is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0% to 100%.
"Survey data is encoded by color: Surveys 2003-2008 (light brown), Surveys 2009-2011 (dark brown)."
A higher proportion of both rural and urban populations were sleeping under ITN in 2009-2011 than in 2003-2008.
There is a positive correlation between the percentage of people sleeping ITN in rural and urban settings.
"The average proportion of population sleeping under ITN, since 2003, has grown linearly."
"In earlier surveys (2003-2008), the average proportion of population sleeping under ITN has been mostly under 40 percent, while in newer surveys (2009-2011) the proportion has peaked at 80 percent."
"In earlier surveys, urban and rural populations sleeping under ITN has been mostly around 0 percent, while in later studies it has risen to an average 20-50 percent."
"During 2003-2008, the proportion of the urban population sleeping under an ITN is quite similar to the proportion of the rural population sleeping under an ITN."
"During 2009-2011, the proportion of the urban population sleeping under an ITN is higher than the population of the rural population, but the proportion has increased for both rural and urban populations."
"In earlier surveys (2003-2008) the proportion of rural and urban populations sleeping under an ITN was close to 0%, with some outliers of 10% for urban populations."
"In later surveys (2009-2011), the proportion of people in both rural and urban areas has mostly increased to 20-60% with some outliers between 60-80%."
In surveys from 2003-2008 neither rural nor urban populations were sleeping under ITN.
In these surveys (2003-2008) more of the urban populations were sleeping under ITN than the rural populations.
In surveys 2009-2011 a much bigger proportion of both populations were sleeping under ITN.
The proportion of the population sleeping under an ITN increased for both rural and urban populations.
The trend suggests that proportion of these populations sleeping under an ITN may still grow.
"As of 2009-2011, there is no survey that suggests 0% of either rural or urban populations are sleeping under an ITN."
"In most surveys from 2003 to 2004, around 4 percent of rural and urban populations were sleeping under an ITN."
"Then in later surveys from 2009 to 2011, they dispersed, with 20-40% of rural and urban populations sleeping under an ITN."
"The later surveys show more variance variance, but the proportion of the population sleeping under an ITN is largely increasing for both rural and urban areas."
"In comparison with surveys from 2003-2008, the surveys from 2009-2011 show more people sleeping under an ITN in rural and urban areas."
"In general, more people seem to be sleeping under an ITN since 2009."
Most surveys indicate people living in urban areas are more likely to be sleeping under an ITN across the entire survey period.
"The two biggest survey outliers were both taken earlier surveys, and suggest that people in urban populations are up to FOUR times as likely to be sleeping under an ITN, as compared with rural populations."
"According to the Center for Disease Control, funding for ITN distribution increased greatly from 2004 to 2010, which explains why the proportions are higher in later surveys."
The proportions of rural and urban populations sleeping under the ITN are similar during both time intervals.
"However, from 2009-2011 there is a large increase in the proportions, compared to the proportions from the 2003-2008 surveys."
A scatterplot entitled “Cars by Country Origin” that plots cars’ Horsepower versus Miles_per_Gallon by Origin.
"Car Origin includes Europe, Japan, and USA, encoded by Color and Shape: Europe (blue, circle), Japan (orange, square), and USA (red, triangle)."
Horsepower is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0 to 250 with an increment of 50.
Miles_per_Gallon is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 50 with an increment of 10.
"Europe specializes in manufacturing cars most suited for urban environments, low horsepower and greater mileage."
Japan has the most economical car at roughly 60 horsepower with a mileage of over 45 miles per gallon.
The majority of cars manufactured in Japan deliver a mileage of 30-35 miles per gallon.
"Cars manufactured in the USA usually have lower mileage but greater horsepower, with most of them delivering 80-120 horsepower but barely 30 miles per gallon of mileage."
"The USA leads in manufacturing cars with high horsepower (sports cars), with the fastest one reaching almost 240 horsepower."
"Overall, the USA manufactures more cars than Europe or Japan."
The USA cars consume more fuel than the others.
The USA cars tend to have more horsepower.
Cars manufactured in Japan and Europe are more efficient than cars manufactured in the USA.
"The less Miles_per_Gallon a car has, the higher its Horsepower, and vice-versa."
"This makes sense because a more powerful engine consumes a lot more fuel to be able to attain speeds, and therefore has lower miles per gallon."
"Cars are also grouped by region of origin, and we can observe that cars from Europe and Japan tend to have less horsepower compared with cars from the USA."
"European and Japanese cars consume less fuel, and so they have higher miles per gallon."
"Overall, cars manufactured in the USA have the highest horsepower."
"European and Japanese cars have more miles per gallon, but they have lower horsepower."
"Compared to Europe and Japan, the USA does a poor job of manufacturing environmentally efficient cars."
"Japanese cars have the highest miles per gallon, and are therefore most environmentally friendly."
"European cars are in-between: they are more fuel efficient USA cars, but have more horsepower than Japanese cars."
"Japanese cars tend to have less horsepower, but are less gas expensive."
European cars are kind of a middle ground but still trending more toward prioritizing fuel efficiency over horsepower.
USA cars have lot more horsepower but use a lot more gas.
Japan produces a car that is an outlier in this trend: it has 133 horsepower for 33 miles per gallon.
USA cars seem to be more powerful in terms of horsepower.
European and Japanese cars seem to be more economical and gas efficient.
Japanese cars seem to be the most economical out of all countries of origin.
"According to plot, USA cars tend have the highest amount of Horsepower."
"For cars with a Horsepower from 140 to 240, all of them are manufactured in the USA."
"At the same time, these are also cars with the lowest Miles_per_Gallon."
"According to the plot, European cars are the most efficient (most Miles_per_Gallon)."
"The amount of Horsepower is also related to efficiency (the greater the Horsepower, the lower the Miles_per_Gallon)."
"Japan manufactures the cars with the most miles per gallon, and seems to focus on that aspect of car manufacturing."
"The USA manufactures cars with the most Horsepower, and seems to focus on that aspect of car manufacturing."
Europe manufactures cars that are in the middle regarding both horsepower and miles per gallon.
Japan produces the car with the greatest Miles_per_Gallon.
USA produces the car with the fewest Miles_per_Gallon.
Most cars have around 40 to 120 Horsepower.
Most of the cars can drive around 20 to 40 Miles_per_Gallon.
Japan produces the cars with the greatest miles per gallon and the USA produces the cars with the fewest miles per gallon.
You can conclude that Japan and Europe produce cars with the least horsepower and the most miles per gallon with the majority falling between 60 and 120 horsepower.
Almost all cars produced in Europe and Japan have less horsepower but the most miles per gallon.
"Overall, the majority of cars produced originate from the USA."
The country of origin that produces the car with the greatest miles per gallon is Japan.
The country of origin that produces the car with the fewest miles per gallon is the USA.
The trend suggests that Europe and Japan make cars with better Miles per gallon and the USA makes cars with better horsepower.
"One reason the USA might focus less on miles per gallon than horsepower is because of the USA's highways and freeways: Americans want to get to their destination quickly, and there are gas stations everywhere so stopping for gas isn't a big problem for these drivers."
Europe and Japan focus on miles per gallon because they are focused more on efficiency and also the environment rather than how fast the vehicles can go.
Japan produces the car with the greatest miles per gallon and USA the fewest miles per gallon.
Japan produces the car with the greatest Miles_per_Gallon.
USA produces the car with the fewest Miles_per_Gallon.
Japan produces more efficient cars (more Miles_per_Gallon) at the cost of horsepower.
USA produces more powerful cars at the cost of efficiency (fewer Miles_per_Gallon).
European cars seem to be in balance between power and efficiency.
Americans seem to prefer more powerful cars.
Japanese seem to prefer more efficient cars.
Japan produces the car with the greatest Miles_per_Gallon.
The car with the fewest Miles_per_Gallon is produced by USA.
It seems Europe and Japan do not produce cars with horsepower more than 140.
"USA produces the widest range of cars in both Horsepower and Miles_per_Gallon, including cars with the highest horsepower."
"Europe and Japan seems to prefer cars with higher Miles_per_Gallon, which is economically more practical and efficient."
"USA produces a wide range of cars, which may appeal to a wider range of customers."
"Cars with high Horsepower but low Miles_per_Gallon tend to be luxury cars, so wealthy people who are car enthusiasts may be attracted to the USA car market."
A scatter plot entitled “The Three Types of Adam Sandler Movies” subtitled “Box office gross in 2014 dollars vs.
Rotten Tomatoes rating”.
The Box office gross is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 0 to 550m with an increment of 100m.
The Rotten Tomatoes rating is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 0 to 100% with an increment of 25%.
Generally the Adam Sandler movies with the lowest rotten Tomatoes ratings do not gross highly at the box office.
A movie with a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes does not necessarily mean it will gross highly at the box office.
"Conversely, a high grossing movie may not necessarily mean it will rate highly on Rotten Tomatoes."
It appears than the Adam Sandler movies that ranked the highest on Rotten Tomatoes did not have the highest box office gross.
"In the Paydays category, most movies got less than 50% in Rotten Tomatoes, but represented the highest box office sales."
Receiving a high rating in rotten tomatoes doesn't signify that it sells well in the box office.
None of the Adam Sandler movies received more than $400 million in the box office.
None of the movies received a rating higher than around 8 on Rotten Tomatoes.
Some of the movies that sell well in the box office still have a very low rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
The chart shows that good ratings don't necessarily lead good sales.
"People tend to move to what is more ""atractive to the eye"" and buy a ticket for that movie, but the movie could be really bad as rated by Rotten Tomatoes (for example, the Paydays category) and but people will still go to see it, so the Box Office Gross for that movie goes up."
"In the He's Trying category, the movies seem to be highly rated, but people didn't buy has many tickets, despite the movies receiving a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes."
All the movies are grouped in in terms of ratings and tickets sold.
"In each category, it appears as though the difference from the lowest to highest grossing movie is around 200 million dollars."
"For example, in the Pineapples category, the lowest grossing movie is around 0 million, but the highest grossing movie almost reaches 200 million."
"In the He's Trying category, the lowest grossing movie is around 350 million, while the highest is around 200 million, and the same for The Paydays category."
There doesn't appear to be a direct correlation between Rotten Tomatoes rating and the box office gross.
The groups of movies appear to obtain similar box office earnings and Rotten Tomatoes ratings.
There is no crossover between groups.
The Paydays received some of the lowest Rotten Tomatoes ratings whilst having the highest box office gross.
"In comparison, movies in the Pineapples group received some of the lower Rotten Tomatoes ratings, but also the lower box office gross."
"The highest rated type of movies under the ""He's Trying"" category with a rating around 50 and 75%, but it also has one the lowest box office gross reaching just a little over $0M."
"The biggest box office gross is observed for the movies ""The Paydays"" category, such as Grown Ups 2."
"However, movies in this category have a poor Rotten Tomatoes ratings at less than 50%."
"Last but not least, the movies under the type of ""The Pineapples"" category have both the lowest ratings and the lowest box office gross."
"Overall, the higher the Rotten Tomatoes rating, the lower the box office gross."
"The three types of Adam Sandler's movies are The Paydays, The Pineapples and He's Trying."
"All movie type's have examples like Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy and The Wedding Singer."
"There are 7 The Pineapples movies, 14 The Paydays movies, and 7 He's Trying movies."
"Summing up, there are 28 Adam Sandler movies."
The worst Rotten Tomatoes ratings are in The Pineapples type.
The best ratings are in the He's Trying type.
"The highest Bbx office gross is around 365 million, and the lowest is around 5-10 million."
There is no correlation between the Rotten Tomatoes rating and the box office gross.
Movies in the Paydays group seem to earn more as suggested by the name.
Movies in the The Pineapples group did not do well in either in terms of rating or box office gross.
Movies in the He's Trying group had the highest Rotten Tomatoes ratings.
The more mainstream movies such as Grown Ups 2 seem to do much better at the box office.
"This could be because the movie is a sequel with an established audience, and so sells more tickets."
"We can see that The Paydays types of movies usually have the best Box office gross of all Adam Sandler movies, regardless of the Rotten Tomatoes rating."
The Pineapples usually get the worst kind of rating from Rotten Tomatoes as well as low Box office gross.
"As for the He's Trying movies, despite getting the best ratings, they earn about the same in Box office gross as The Pineapples."
A scatter plot entitled “Born in 2016: Life Expectancy Gap by Gender and Income” that plots Women Life Expectancy at Birth (Years) by Men Life Expectancy at Birth (Years).
The Women Life Expectancy at Birth is plotted on the vertical y-axis from 40 to 90 years.
The Men Life Expectancy at Birth is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 40 to 90 years.
High Income Countries are plotted in dark green.
Low Income Countries are plotted in light green.
A 45 degree line from the origin represents Equal Life Expectancy.
Women consistently have a higher life expectancy than men.
Life expectancy for both men and women is significantly higher in high income countries versus low income countries.
The trend is that in higher income countries have a higher life expectancy for men and women.
Women have a slightly higher life expectancy than men.
"For low income countries, the average life expectancy is 60 years for men and 65 years for women."
"For high income countries, the average life expectancy is 77 years for men and 82 years for women."
"Overall, women live longer than men."
Women generally tend to have a longer life expectancy.
Men generally tend to have a shorter life expectancy.
"People living in low-income countries tend to have a lower life expectancy than the people living in high-income countries, likely due to many societal factors, including access to healthcare, food, other resources, and overall quality of life."
Women live longer than men on average.
Men from lower income countries are likely to have a lower life expectancy.
Women from lower income countries are likely to have a lower life expectancy.
People who live in lower income countries are more likely to experience deprivation and poverty.
They are more likely to have poor working and living conditions and can develop health problems linked to this.
"Women are slightly more conscious of their health and are more likely to seek professional help, such as booking a doctors appointment when feeling ill."
This could explain them having a longer life expectancy
Men and women in high income countries have a higher life expectancy.
Women generally live longer than men.
The age divide might mean that people in low income countries don't have the possibility to take care of themselves as much as people in high income countries.
On the whole women have higher life expectancies than men.
Those with the lower incomes tend to live the shortest lives as well.
"The high income countries are denoted by the dark green circles, and it can be concluded that higher income countries have higher life expectancy."
This is because of the better healthcare infrastructure in place and research funding in these countries.
"The graph does not explain what the income age divide line means, but it suggests that countries to the left of it are poor countries (where people have a shorter lifespan), and countries to the right of the line are wealthier counties (where people have a longer lifespan)."
Women live longer then men.
Lower income countries have lower life expectancy than in high income countries.
The low income countries are more scattered than the high income countries.
"There is a visible gap between high and low income countries, indicated by the Income-Age Divide line."
"On average, the chart shows a positive linear trend between."
"People living in high income countries have a higher average life expectancy for both women and men, compared to their average life expectancy in low income countries."
People living in High Income Countries are predicted to live 15-20 years more than people living in Low Income Countries.
It is more probable that women born in High Income Countries live 5 years more than men.
It is not expected that women live more than 15 years than men in Low Income Countries or High Income Countries.
"A scatter plot entitled “EU countries have largely converged at the national level” with a subtitle “Level and change in GDP per capita, EU countries”."
The Change in GDP per capita is plotted on the vertical y-axis from -20 to +20.
The GDP per capita is plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 40 to 140.
The dots plotted are labeled with their country name.
"The plot contains various annotations: Poor countries catching up, Poor countries getting poorer, Rich countries getting richer, Rich countries dropping back."
Most countries are poorer than the EU average.
Only 2 countries are getting poorer while being poorer than the EU average (Portugal and Greece).
Most countries are poorer than the EU average but are catching up.
"Only 3 countries are getting richer while being richer than the EU average (Belgium, Denmark, and Austria)."
Some countries are richer than the EU average but are dropping back.
Slovenia is close to getting poorer while being poorer than the EU average.
Greece and Portugal are poor countries that are getting poorer (Greece is the poorer of the two).
There are 10 countries that were poor and now they are catching up.
"They are Slovenia (the poorer of the ten), Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania and Romania (the richer of the ten)."

"They are Austria (the poorer of the 3), Denmark and Belgium (the richer of the 3)."
"Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Hungary have similar GDP values."
"The richer European countries like France, Germany, U.K. Spain and Italy are losing some wealth."
"A lot of rich countries are becoming poorer, whereas not many are becoming richer."
"A lot of poorer countries are catching up to the bigger countries, and very few are getting worse."
This shows that overall countries are becoming more equal in terms of their GDP.
The GDP of most countries that are poorer than EU average are rising.
"The GDP of countries that are richer than the EU average are near +0 or below 0, suggesting that they are on a downward trend."
"Among poor countries, Greece has the largest negative change in its GDP."
"Among poor countries, Romania has the largest positive change in its GDP."
"Among rich countries, Italy has the largest negative change in its GDP."
"Among rich countries, Belgium has the largest positive change in its GDP."
"Some large differences can be observed in the GDP per capita between countries, with Romania around 42 and the Netherlands almost reaching 140 for instance."
"Two clusters of countries can be seen, one comprised of countries with a GDP per capita ranking from 40 to 60 and the other one comprising countries ranking from 100 to 140."
"Large gaps in GDP per capita can be also observed at a geographical level, and a divide between Western/Northern Europe and Eastern Europe/Balkan is striking."
Greece is the country with the lowest change in GDP per capita (-23).
The highest change in GDP per capita can be observed in Romania (+23) even thought the GDP per capita in this country still remains one of the lowest one of the EU.
Most of the country with the highest GDP per capita are however dropping back and have seen a decrease over the years.
"Belgium, Denmark and Austria are richer than the EU average and are becoming richer."
"Greece has a GDP close to the EU average, but is the country with the largest negative change in GDP."
Greece and Portugal are poorer than the EU average and becoming poorer.
"Most of poor countries are becoming richer, while most of the rich countries are becoming poorer."
"Poland, Romania and Lithuania have the largest positive change in GDP per capita."
Greece has largest negative change in GDP per capita.
Countries that already have a high GDP per capita have lower change in GDP per capita.
"Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Slovakia, Hungary, Estonia, Czechia and Slovenia are countries that are poor and catching up with positive change in GDP per capita."
Portugal and Greece are poor countries that getting poorer.
"Belgium, Denmark and Austria are rich countries getting richer."
"Germany, France, United Kingdoms, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands are rich countries that are dropping back in GDP per capita."
There are 4 categories of European countries by GDP increase/decrease per year.
"The categories are as stated: ""Poor countries catching up"", ""Poor countries getting poorer"", ""Rich countries getting richer"", and ""Rich countries dropping back""."
"In Poor countries catching up, we can see the following countries: Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Czechia, Slovenia."
In Poor countries getting poorer we can see the following countries: Portugal and Greece.
"In Rich counries getting richer we can the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, and Austria."

There are eight rich countries which are rich but dropping back.
"There is a stronger trend of poor countries catching up, than rich countries dropping back."
"There is a stronger trend of poor countries catching up, than rich countries dropping back."
Denmark and Austria have similar GDP.
"Because Rich countries are dropping back and poor countries are catching up, this is advantageous for countries struggling to improve their economy."
A scatter plot entitled “Total COVID-19 tests conducted vs.
Confirmed cases” that plots the total tests by the total confirmed cases of COVID-19.
"The total tests are plotted on the vertical y-axis from 10,000 to 1 million."
"The total confirmed cases are plotted on the horizontal x-axis from 61 to 100,000 using a logarithmic scale."
"The plotted countries are color coded by their continent: Africa (gold), Asia (green), Europe (blue), North America (red), Oceania (purple), South America (burgundy)."
"The number of COVID-19 tests ranges from 10,000 to 1 million."
"The number of confirmed cases ranges from 61 to 100,000."
The USA has the highest number of tests and the highest number confirmed cases.
Bolivia has lowest number of tests and about 1000 confirmed cases.
"Uganda has a low number of tests and the lowest number of cases, about 100."
"Overall, countries in Africa have done the fewest COVID tests, but this can't confirm that they also have the lowest number of cases, which may be unknown due to limited testing."
The African countries have done much fewer COVID-19 tests than the others first world countries.
Uganda has the lowest number of confirmed cases (61) but has also conducted very few tests.
"The USA has done more than a million tests, but it has the most confirmed cases."
Almost all the tests done in Bolivia are confirmed cases.
"We can observe that the more COVID-19 tests we conduct, the more cases we are likely to confirm."
"Based on this trend, the countries that conducted the fewest COVID-19 tests are also the countries that reported the fewest number of cases, and vice-versa."
Most confirmed COVID-19 cases are in the countries with the most tests conducted.
Fewer confirmed cases are found in the countries with fewer tests conducted.
There is a positive trend between the number of COVID-19 tests conducted and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
"The more the tests are conducted, the more the cases registered."
"The USA is leading with more than 1 million tests conducted and more than 100,000 confirmed cases."
Countries in Africa (gold) have a lower test vs confirmed case ratio.
Countries in Europe (blue) and North America (red) have higher test vs confirmed cases ratio.
"There are some outliers in European countries where there are a lot of tests conducted but fewer confirmed cases (Latvia, Solvenia, Croatia, and Lithuania)"
"Countries in Africa have the fewest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and also the fewest number of tests conducted."
Overall Europe has the most number of cases of all regions in the world.
The United State has the most number of cases of all the countries.
In general the more COVID19 tests conducted the higher the number of cases (positive correlation).
Vietnam is an outlier as they conducted more tests yet still have fewer confirmed cases.
"Europe is the continent that provided the most data, South America has provided the least."
Countries that are considered wealthier have been able to conduct more tests.
"The United States is the country with the highest number of confirmed cases, and number of conducted tests."
"The continent with the highest amount of both cases and tests, is Europe."
Bolivia is the country with the lowest amount of total tests.
"A big part of Africa doesn't have many tests, and doesn't have many total cases."
"In most cases, there is a strong positive correlation between total number of tests conducted, and the number of cases: the higher the total of tests, the higher the number of cases."
The continent with the lowest amount of both cases and tests seems to be Africa.
